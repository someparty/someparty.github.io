The second single from Sam Coffey&#39;s upcoming album swings for the fences, demonstrating an enormous leap in both the band&#39;s ambitions and the conviction that they can pull it off. The ballad clocks in at over seven minutes, a slow burn that surfaces the soul buried in Coffey&#39;s gravelly wail. When a downright sultry sax appears before the first chorus, it&#39;s clear this is a different flavour of maximalism. I suspect the Iron Lungs of ol&#39; would have nervously kicked this song into high gear before long, safe in the gleeful exuberance of muscular rock&#39;n&#39;roll. Here they&#39;re focused enough to let a good thing breathe, and while the band&#39;s usual bombast can&#39;t be far off, it&#39;s not required. &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; just cruises down the open road, sunroof down, never in a hurry to get anywhere. It&#39;s fantastic, and I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on <em>Real One</em> in a few weeks.</p><p>Coffey spoke about the track, juxtaposing the confidence exhibited in its sprawling scope with his past doubts:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song is about letting go... I&#39;m trying to pose less and be more genuine as I get older. I used to obsess over this band and constantly loop around how I felt I never received enough recognition for the little amount that I contributed. I even used to spin out and assume out of thin-air that my peers or other artists in my circle thought I was a joke. It&#39;s more likely that my friends and peers support me or I just don&#39;t cross their mind at all. But it&#39;s a toxic view to have and I feel super fortunate to not dwell on it anymore. All it took was getting off my ass and going for it to give myself some peace of mind.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>There&#39;s a recurring rhyme scheme on this track that really reminds me of Television&#39;s &quot;Venus&quot; - and of course, that means my mind wanders to &quot;Marquee Moon,&quot; another famously long song that&#39;s so blissfully cool it never feels like a slog. &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; has that effect, and were it also eleven minutes rather than seven, I&#39;d be just fine with that.</p><p><em>Real One</em> arrives February 19 from <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a>. The band&#39;s third record rolls in just about three years after the group&#39;s Thin Lizzy-worshipping self-titled LP. <em>Real One</em> features Coffey backed by Dave Tyson on keys, lead guitarist Liam Doyle, Joel &quot;French&quot; Desbois on rhythm guitar, bassist Richard Stanley, and drummer Connor Glen. Guests on the record (and this song in particular) include backing vocalist Siânteuse, <a href="https://destroyer.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Destroyer</a>&#39;s Joseph Shabason on the above-mentioned saxophone, and a full string quartet arranged by Paul Erlichman of <a href="http://ducksunlimitedband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ducks Unlimited</a>. The Toronto-based group worked with producer Kevin Ratterman (White Reaper, Strand of Oaks, Murder By Death) on the record.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3477994460/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=1135950938/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://samcoffeyandtheironlungs.bandcamp.com/album/real-one">Real One by Sam Coffey and The Iron Lungs</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=tough_age><span class=artist-title><a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Anti-Anxiety Exercises&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/xO_D-H6l4i4" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a> recently shared an animated video featuring &quot;Anti-Anxiety Exercises,&quot; their latest highlight from last summer&#39;s <em>Which Way Am I?</em>. The clip features animation by <a href="https://www.vicomart.com/" class="" target=_blank>Victor Martins</a>, an acclaimed Toronto-based cartoonist from the <a href="https://helloboyfriend.itch.io/" class="" target=_blank>Hello Boyfriend</a> collective. They&#39;re the latest in a string of indie comics talent to work on the band&#39;s visuals (a group that includes Wowee Zonk member <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mewnettelapalmew/" class="" target=_blank>Ginette Lapalme</a> and Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://www.connorwillumsen.com/" class="" target=_blank>Connor Willumsen</a>).</p><p>The video arrives as Tough Age finds itself in a state of flux, with bassist Penny Clark and guitarist Jarrett Samson leaving Toronto in the midst of the pandemic. While their ultimate destination is Vancouver, the group&#39;s first home, the pair are waiting out the winter in a family cabin. Samson referenced their change of scenery, and a resulting lack of anxiety, in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The silver lining of this weird world is that I had a legitimate excuse to make no appearances and become as much of a bubblegum band as we were able to be. Victor is someone whose talent flat out awes me so I was thrilled to just hand it to them and offer no comment until the final product arrived and I found out that was the right call.</p><p>Penny and I needed these exercises a lot in the city but now that we live in the woods I&#39;m chopping a lot of wood and cut my hair into a cute bob so things are looking up.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Martins broke down some of the imagery in the video:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I wanted to show people dealing with high-anxiety, stressful situations in different ways: a flight response -- disengaging and running away; a fight response -- blowing everything up; and self-soothing, taking the time to catch your breath and do something nice for yourself. Acknowledging you need a little break, but that after you feel okay, you have to go back and deal with your life. Once I knew that&#39;s what I was going for, the ornithologists and astronaut dogs just sort of showed up.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Tough Age features Clark and Samson with drummer Jesse Locke. <em>Which Way Am I?</em>, the band&#39;s fourth LP, arrived in August of 2020 on <a href="https://www.mintrecs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mint Records</a>.

While details are to come on that release, the group&#39;s already shared moody album cut &quot;I&#39;m Leaving&quot; as our first preview. Souvenir features bassist Lachie MacDonald, guitarist Dave Banoub, and drummer Chris Murdoch, veterans of several east coast projects. MacDonald played in an early version of Cape Breton ensemble <a href="https://thetomfunorchestra.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Tom Fun Orchestra</a>, later appearing with Halifax post-punk groups <a href="https://alrightalready.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Great Plains</a> and <a href="https://dyscontrol.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Dyscontrol</a>.

Before embarking on this year-long cycle, the group released a 5-song EP titled <em>Group Dynamics</em> in 2019.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=528840001/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://heckyeahlaurie.bandcamp.com/track/another-animal">Another Animal by Laurie</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=roach><span class=artist-title><a href="https://roachband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Roach</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Everything or Nothing&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://roachband.bandcamp.com/track/everything-or-nothing-demo" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto indie rock quartet <a href="https://roachband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Roach</a> has a new pair of songs online, a sparkling and confessional demo titled &quot;Everything or Nothing,&quot; and a cover of Snail Mail&#39;s &quot;Heat Wave.&quot; You can check them out now at Bandcamp.</p><p>Roach last released the emo-pop tune &quot;R.I.P.

The band commented, through their label <a href="https://www.suddendeath.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sudden Death Records</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We hope you are coping OK with the pandemic. We have unearthed some classic D.O.A. footage from 1978 of Chuck, Randy and Joey playing The Prisoner, the footage was shot in a dingy practice room by Soundproof host John Tanner. Just to make the footage even more fun, Shithead dug around his basement and found never before seen photos and added those to the video. This is dedicated to memory of Randy Rampage and Dave Gregg, you are both missed greatly.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The <em>Something Better Change</em> reissue includes a reproduction of the original lyric insert paired with a photo booklet of the band&#39;s classic lineup (guitarist/vocalist Joey Shithead, bassist Randy Rampage, guitarist Dave Gregg, and drummer Chuck Biscuits). It arrives on the heels of the group&#39;s most recent LP, <em>Treason</em>. That album, laser-focused on soon-to-be-ex President Trump, arrived in March of 2020.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mB9rkceUN4U" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2021-01-24-half-rich-loner/" rel=next title="Next article: Half Rich Loner"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Half Rich Loner</div> <div class=pagination-date>January 24, 2021</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2021-01-10-oversimplification/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Oversimplification"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Oversimplification</div> <div class=pagination-date>January 10, 2021</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

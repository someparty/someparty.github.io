Thanks for sticking around.</p><hr/><p>Lost in the fog of May I entirely missed the lead-up to the brilliant debut full-length from Montreal art-punks <a href="https://lungbuttermtl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lungbutter</a>, but <em>Honey</em> is out now and well worth your attention. The gloriously discordant record marks the trio&#39;s first release since 2014&#39;s <em>Extractor</em> EP. It arrives through <a href="http://cstrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constellation Records</a> (Godspeed You! Black Emperor).</p><p>Lungbutter features vocalist Ky Brooks, drummer Joni Sadler, and guitarist Kaity Zozula. The three have collectively served in numerous bands over the years, including some intense Montreal punk acts like <a href="https://femmemaggots.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Femmaggots</a>, <a href="https://hashrealty.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Harsh Reality</a>, Caymans, Nennen, Wreckage With Stick, and Nag. Anchored in Brooks&#39; provocative half-spoken lyrics, the band assembled 11 noisy, dynamic tracks for the new collection, which vary wildly from dissonant No Wave to sludgy post-punk. The album&#39;s press release takes a good swing at capturing their sound:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Lungbutter&#39;s minimal guitar-drums-voice configuration is rooted in a visceral, ascetic punk idiom, refracted variously by free-noise, sludge rock and slowcore. Zozula marshals chaotic motifs of full-spectrum distorto-guitar, occupying a huge tonal space from low-end bass to paint-peeling treble, redolent of blown-out Melvins/Flipper fuzz and equally indebted to the frenetic dissonance of Keiji Haino or Merzbow (as in the thrilling passages of warped noise on &#39;Solar&#39; or &#39;Veneer&#39;). Song structures coalesce around guitar riffs of shifting tempos and the backbone of Sadler&#39;s muscular, deliberate drums, while Brooks&#39; voice – at once mantric and declarative – deconstructs one brilliant lyrical theme after another, dancing along the knife-edge of dispassionate acerbic examination and wide-eyed cathartic revelation.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Toronto music writer <a href="https://twitter.com/therewasnosound" class="" target=_blank>Michael Rancic</a>&#39;s recent interview with the band for <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2019/06/03/lungbutter-honey-interview/" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp Daily</a> sheds some light into the gap between releases and Lungbutter&#39;s approach to the studio.</p><p><em>Honey</em> was recorded and mixed by Radwan Ghazi Moumneh at Hotel2Tango in Montreal, with Harris Newman at Greymarket mastering.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=643380852/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://lungbuttermtl.bandcamp.com/album/honey">Honey by Lungbutter</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://lungbuttermtl.bandcamp.com/album/honey" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Lungbutter - <em>Honey</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Also in my absence, Toronto&#39;s playfully weird punk outfit <a href="https://imhughman.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hugh Man</a> shared a new EP under the title <em>Hughs Man is it Anyway?</em>. The group (which features members of <a href="https://leatherjacuzzi.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Leather Jacuzzi</a> and <a href="https://scorpiorisinghc.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Scorpio Rising</a>) recorded this past April with <a href="https://feelalright.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Feel Alright</a>&#39;s Craig Fahner. The 6-song set boasts such future classics of lo-fi snark as &quot;Sad Boy,&quot; &quot;Huge Man,&quot; and &quot;Kratom Pride (In the Name of Love).&quot; The new songs follow up the band&#39;s summer 2018 demos, <em>Are We Dan, Sir?</em>.</p><p>Hugh Man will publically launch the new tunes with a joint release show on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/904228303256681/" class="" target=_blank>July 6</a> at Toronto&#39;s Monarch Tavern. That gig will also debut new releases from both the frantic Toronto punks <a href="https://wlmrt.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>WLMRT</a> (following up their 2018 Pleasance EP <em>Lube 2</em>) and Bria Salmena&#39;s <a href="http://sigil.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sigil</a>. The latter&#39;s a side-project of <a href="https://frigsmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>FRIGS</a> vocalist, featuring Salmena supported by members of <a href="https://deliluh.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Deliluh</a> and <a href="http://ytstlabs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Yamantaka // Sonic Titan</a>. Sigil was last active a few years ago when that same backing personnel were all playing together as members of the dark sludge-punk act <a href="https://hsy666.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>HSY</a>.</p><p>There&#39;s a special guest to be announced the day of the show as well (&quot;very special,&quot; in fact). Your guess is as good as mine. All I know is it isn&#39;t me, or at least nobody&#39;s told me yet.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2939804891/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://imhughman.bandcamp.com/album/hughs-man-is-it-anyway-2">Hughs Man is it Anyway? by Hugh Man</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://imhughman.bandcamp.com/album/hughs-man-is-it-anyway-2" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Hugh Man - <em>Hughs Man is it Anyway?</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>The lo-fi Toronto-based <a href="https://madelink.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>PAX</a> has a pair of new songs online, collected under the title <em>Eat Me</em>. The laid-back tracks, titled &quot;Holy Water&quot; and &quot;Clingfilm,&quot; showcase a slow-burning slacker rock vibe (particularly the latter). They follow PAX&#39;s recent single release from March, titled &quot;Sink.&quot;</p><p>PAX was initially the bedroom recording project of Madeline Link (one-half of the jangle-pop duo <a href="https://triplesband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Triples</a>). Upon the recent cassette release of her full-length <em>Ouch</em> (on <a href="https://www.artoftheuncarvedblock.com/" class="" target=_blank>Art of the Uncarved Block</a>), PAX grew to become a full live band. These new tracks feature drummer Shane Hooper, bassist Noah O&#39;Neil, and guitarist Dexter Nash, with Link responsible for vocals and everything else you can hear.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2432653926/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://madelink.bandcamp.com/album/eat-me">eat me by PAX</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://madelink.bandcamp.com/album/eat-me" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: PAX - <em>eat me</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Halifax-bred indie rock act <a href="https://mauno.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mauno</a> is back in action, with a new full-length scheduled for an August 2 release titled <em>Really Well</em>. The pensive first single from the album, &quot;Really Really,&quot; arrived alongside a video by <a href="http://www.maxtaeuschel.com/" class="" target=_blank>Max Taeuschel</a> (Pottery) that takes the band&#39;s core songwriting duo to the gym. <a href="https://tinangelrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tin Angel Records</a>, the group&#39;s UK home, had this to say about the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Written by Eliza Niemi before she moved to Germany two summers ago, &#39;Really Really&#39; is about the fear of losing touch with friends and family who define your identity, and the realisation that geographical distance doesn&#39;t have to result in that.</p><p>The song explores exhaustion and perseverance when faced with a seemingly endless and inconsequential task. Mauno&#39;s very real and intensive exercise serves as a fitting way to represent this – placing the band in an arduous video shoot that pushed them to their physical limit. The accompanying visuals ultimately posits that sometimes, when engaging in an absurd and terrible cycle, it&#39;s best to simply stop.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new record finds Niemi and co-vocalist Nick Everett splitting the songwriting duties across 11 tracks. Niemi plays bass and keyboard on the album, with Everett on guitar and keys as well. Mauno also features guitarist Scott Bourdreau and drummer Adam White (not me). <a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chad VanGaalen</a> tracked the record at his Yoko Eno studio.</p><p>Mauno last released <em>Tuning</em> on <a href="https://www.ideefixerecords.com" class="" target=_blank>Idée Fixe</a> and Tin Angel in 2017.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jd3rMbrERiQ" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/jd3rMbrERiQ" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Mauno - &quot;Really Really&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>The release date for <em>Really Well</em> coincides with the band&#39;s scheduled appearance at this year&#39;s <a href="http://www.sappyfest.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sappyfest</a> in Sackville, New Brunswick.

The group waxed philosophical on the song&#39;s meaning in a recent statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Through fantasy and the starkest of realities, this song brings to question the process in which economic value is prescribed to cultural artifacts, how that value is exploited through storing them in high security storage facilities (like the Geneva Freeport) to avoid paying taxes, and how it all seems so antithetical to why most artists create their work in the first place.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song follows the earlier release of &quot;Currency,&quot; which featured Meg Remy of <a href="http://yousgirls.blogspot.ca/" class="" target=_blank>U.S. Girls</a> on lead vocals. The record will also feature &quot;The Endless Scroll.&quot; Clocking in at 9 minutes, that track features instrumentation from <a href="https://carldidur.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Carl Didur</a> of the prolific TO psych duo <a href="https://zachtautomaat.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Zacht Automaat</a>.</p><p><em>Geneva Freeport</em> arrives as a 12&quot; on June 20.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXB9P9_H7u8" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/wXB9P9_H7u8" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Absolutely Free - &quot;Geneva Freeport&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>My week away saw two fresh cuts from the upcoming <a href="https://dumbband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dumb</a> full-length <em>Club Nites</em>.

The pain... O the pain... But O the rigidity in environs the faith in seasons and acquaintances not found irl.</p><p>The static universe... There for anyone to bob and flow upon and forge an individuality otherwise precluded by one&#39;s social anxiety WHICH is only further entrenched by endless tv watching and saturation with bit form paradigms of humanity. Also it&#39;s a jungle&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the laid-back &quot;Radio 3,&quot; named after the one-time online music magazine and indie-CanCon podcast, premiered at <a href="http://post-trash.com/news/2019/5/30/dumb-cbc-radio-3-post-trash-premiere" class="" target=_blank>Post-Trash</a>.</p><p>Dumb recorded <em>Club Nites</em> in their Vancouver studio this past winter, less than a year since their last LP, <em>Seeing Green</em>.

The band&#39;s performing in head-to-toe caribou in the live footage, which might be a first (although when you break it down, most Northern Haze facts qualify as &quot;firsts&quot;).</p><p><em>Siqinnaarut</em>, the band&#39;s second record, was released last November, an astonishing 33 years after their debut. Northern Haze currently features original members Naisana Qamaniq, James Ungalaq, and John Inooya, with Derek Aqqiaruq and Allan Kangok. They recorded in January of 2018 in Iqaluit with producer Michael Wojewoda (Buffy Sainte-Marie, Rheostatics).</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JDTV0NWeAm0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/JDTV0NWeAm0" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Northern Haze - &quot;Qainna&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>A third single from the Ottawa synth-pop duo <a href="https://surrendersounds.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Surrender</a> arrived last week.

This record sees the project expanded to a four-piece band featuring drummer Victor Malang, guitarist Matthew Fleming, and keyboardist/vocalist Kori Pop. The new record was partly tracked in Ireland at Grouse Lounge Studios.</p><p>In a <a href="http://www.stagerightsecrets.com/exclusive-premiere-don-vail-on-the-wire/" class="" target=_blank>Stage Right Secrets</a> premiere for the video showcasing the title track, Bowden commented on how the song came together and the band&#39;s experience recording abroad:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#39;s hard to say what the initial inspiration for it was, but I remember the general structure coming together quickly (like, in one sitting), which is rare for us. I had a cheap old guitar in an oddball tuning and just kind hammered out 3 parts that happened to work well together. The lyrics came later, after a lengthy swim through the sewer of popular culture. The song, like the rest of the record, was self-produced. We took the demo session to Ireland where we re-tracked the drums and bass at Grouse Lodge with Cameron Craig. The two weeks we spent there felt like a dream. Grouse Lodge is this magical place with a studio and multiple living areas in these beautiful 300-year-old stone buildings surrounded by rolling green hills. We met so many amazing people there and I still have dreams about that place all the time.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WL-T659gcAI" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/WL-T659gcAI" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Don Vail - &quot;On The Wire&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto pop-punk quartet <a href="https://www.facebook.com/badbuzzmusic/" class="" target=_blank>Bad Buzz</a> has spent the past few months trickling songs out through my old haunt at Punknews.org.

The clip&#39;s nostalgic trip, throwing back to the Atari era and perfectly capturing the absurdly epic, electrically-charged 80s vibe this era of the band&#39;s been exploring. Director Zev Deans commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Licensed to Drive&#39; is a deep dive into the soul of a late 1970s living room, an exploration of the deep psychedelic fantasy at the core of the birth of the videogame.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Bandleader Stephen McBean previously spoke to the song itself, calling it &quot;a riff in A flat and some Neu / Nugent / Newman Motorik hustle.&quot;</p><p><em>Destroyer</em> arrived on May 24 from <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone</a> and <a href="https://jagjaguwar.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jagjaguwar</a>. It followed the band&#39;s 2016 full-length <em>IV</em>.

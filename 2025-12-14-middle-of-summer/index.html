It painted my lackadaisical disengagement with mainstream culture as a virtue rather than a blind spot. I&#39;m in my forties now, and quite justifiably out of touch, so I feel entirely comfortable reclaiming that sentiment at face value. So let me say: <a href="https://ponytheband.ca" class="" target=_blank>PONY</a> is a magical band - pure confection - and the fact that they&#39;re not absolutely massive is an aberration of cosmic proportions, and one for which I shall not stand.</p><p>Now my family typically doesn&#39;t factor into these write-ups. They never agreed to live as Cancon ascetics, and I&#39;d not force that life on anyone. But in the truck, my truck, they&#39;re stuck with me and my radio. The other day, my otherwise K-pop-obsessed teenager threw some rare feedback as she left for school, proclaiming, &quot;you usually just listen to the Ramones or loud stuff but I really like that PONY band you keep playing.&quot; Youth approval! We&#39;ve therefore externally validated the parallel truths that while I am indeed aging into irrelevance, I&#39;m also 100% right about PONY.</p><p>The Toronto band returns this February with <em>Clearly Cursed</em>, a ten-song set of bubblegum grunge-pop that promises shimmering hooks and Sam Bielanski&#39;s effortlessly euphoric vocals. In a statement, the singer-songwriter revealed the record&#39;s origins in a portentous psychic reading:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;She read my tarot cards and told me boyfriend was cheating on me. That was true. She also told me that I had a dark spirit attachment which she could easily vanquish if I paid her $1500. That was obviously out of my budget so I left and decided I would have to coexist with this dark spirit for the rest of my life.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Clearly Cursed</em> finds Bielanski and partner/guitarist Matty Morand (<a href="https://prettymatty.com" class="" target=_blank>Pretty Matty</a>) joined by their touring collaborators Christian Beale (This is Hell, Iron Chic) on bass and Joey Ginaldi (Webbed Wing) on drums. Iron Chic&#39;s Dan Leo, who drummed for PONY on their previous go-around, appears as well. The group again worked with producer Alex Gamble (Fucked Up, Alvvays) - reviving the studio team that crafted 2023&#39;s <em>Velveteen</em>.</p><p>You can hear four tracks from the record today, three of which surfaced as stand-alone singles over the past few years. The album opens with the familiar favourites &quot;Superglue&quot; and &quot;Freezer&quot;, with 2024&#39;s earworm &quot;Every Little Crumb&quot; sequenced in the penultimate slot. Those songs are available alongside the newly unveiled &quot;Middle Of Summer.&quot; <em>Clearly Cursed</em> arrives February 13 through <a href="http://www.takethistoheartrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Take This To Heart Records</a>, supported by a late-February East Coast tour with Californian pop-punk act Star 99.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2260428129/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://ponyband.bandcamp.com/album/clearly-cursed">Clearly Cursed by PONY</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=g_a_mksimoon><span class=artist-title><a href="https://gamksimoon.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>G̱a̱mksimoon</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Huk Aat&quot; / &quot;G̱a̱woo Üüla&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://gamksimoon.bandcamp.com/album/huk-aat-g-a-woo-la" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> recently issued the debut 7-inch single from <a href="https://gamksimoon.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>G̱a̱mksimoon</a>, a riff-heavy rock trio from Prince Rupert, British Columbia. The group sings entirely in the Sm&#39;algya̱x language of the Ts&#39;msyen people, which pairs perfectly with a backdrop of 70s-indebted guitar heroism.</p><p>The set features &quot;Huk Aat&quot; on the a-side backed by &quot;G̱a̱woo Üüla,&quot; tracks that draw lyrically on north coast Indigenous tradition and pre-contact ways of life. Band lead Wil Uks Batsga G̱a̱laaw (aka Jeremy Pahl), explained the hunting practices expressed on the b-side:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song is about the protocols Ts&#39;msyen seal hunters have been passing down forever. I&#39;m lucky enough to have learned about this from my uncles. A long time ago our people communicated with the seal people and made this protocol. The song lyrics themselves are pretty self explanatory. I hunt seals in this way today. It&#39;s a great nutritious and delicious food. I like to render the fat into oil to use for frying fish or mixing with berries as a dessert.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The three-piece features Pahl on vocals and guitar, Isaac Story on bass, and Danny Bell on drums. They recorded with John Rahm at Afterlife Studios in Vancouver, with Connor Pritchard mixing at Pulp City in Prince George.</p><p>G̱a̱mksimoon is an evolution of a project formerly known as <a href="https://saltwaterhank.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Saltwater Hank</a>.

In a statement carried by <a href="https://newnoisemagazine.com/news-american-lips-return-with-angular-art-punk-lp-on-strike/" class="" target=_blank>New Noise</a>, Grainger shared some thoughts on the album, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Musically, this record is tight and boxy, like an engine made of wood and elastic bands trying to play pop songs. Lyrically it speaks to this intergenerational sense that we are all alienated, yet how can this be? If we all have the same feelings of &#39;otherness&#39; shouldn&#39;t that make us closer? More able to relate to one another? Strangely no. So this record is at once a warm hug and punch in the neck.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can see the single &quot;Cardboard Trash,&quot; celebrated in a video assembled from walkthrough footage of the 1989 graphic adventure game <em>Space Quest III: The Pirates Of Pestulon</em>. The band commented, &quot;We all played Sierra games as kids and it means a great deal to us to have been able to pay tribute in this way.&quot; The retro digital aesthetic suits the band&#39;s quirky sensibilities perfectly.</p><p>Popovich remains prolific as a producer in Montreal&#39;s indie rock scene and plays these days as part of the space-punk aggressors <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_frvits_/" class="" target=_blank>FRVITS</a>.

The group, which features familiar faces from southern Ontario&#39;s punk scene, delivers a diverse slate of songs that hopscotch nostalgically between subgenres, shifting from emo and pop-punk to post-hardcore and 90s radio rock - a love affair with the collective&#39;s 90s-rooted influences.</p><p>The band wrote and recorded across two weekends, two years apart, in the respective falls of 2022 and 2024, with lyrics by the songwriting duo of Danny Kidd and Ivan Rivers. Kidd sings and plays guitar these days in <a href="https://prowrestlingtheband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pro Wrestling the Band</a> and boasts a lengthy resume that includes <a href="https://neverbetters.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Never Betters</a>, <a href="https://drewthomson.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Drew Thomson Foundation</a>, <a href="https://singlemothersband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Single Mothers</a> and <a href="https://wastedpotential.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Wasted Potential</a>. Rivers is best known for his time in the punk outfit <a href="https://stuckouthere.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stuck Out Here</a> and maintains an eponymous solo career as a self-described <a href="https://ivanrivers.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>celebrated folk icon</a>. The band&#39;s rounded out by drummer Joel Siggelkow (<a href="https://twinband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Twin</a>) and bassist Dustin Andrews (Wasted Potential, <a href="https://snacksareawesome.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Snacks?</a>). Andrews recorded, produced, and mixed the material from his basement studio, with Daggermouth&#39;s Stu McKillop mastering.</p><p>I feel bad that I&#39;ve sat on this one for so long, particularly since Rivers reached out to me with such enthusiasm. If he&#39;ll forgive the privacy breach, here&#39;s a snippet of his pitch that illustrates just that:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We&#39;re so stoked about this thing. It started as a lark and a way to hone D.A.&#39;s burgeoning production chops in his new home studio, but we ended up making 9 killer wild dramatic ridiculous songs about like, killing god and burnt-world romance and fed them through a lifetime of collected alt &amp; scene influences, like Maxell CDRcore. We call it &#39;forest city god-fearing music&#39; and it&#39;s a damn blast.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The album arrived as a joint release through Rivers&#39; Eternal Bummer label and Andrews&#39; <a href="https://getparty.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Get Party!

These songs have percolated for years, some of which first surfaced back in 2019 on the <em>Come Pretty Pump Sleep</em> EP. This is the first time the band&#39;s collected any of its material on wax.</p><p>Multi-disciplinary artist Gwen Morgan fronts the project, leading a collective of local players who&#39;ve built a thrillingly disorienting, sonically asymmetrical series of tunes on a bass-and-drum foundation. The label references the New Wave exotica sound and cult favourites like Inflatable Boy Clams and Sara Goes Pop. Fans of Toronto&#39;s Luge will find familiar ground here.</p><p>The band recorded at Pee Blood Studios, with Orchid&#39;s Will Killingsworth mixing and mastering at Dead Air Studios.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2939969729/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/album/parisian-orgy">Parisian Orgy by Parisian Orgy</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=the_wesleys><span class=artist-title><a href="https://thewesleys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Wesleys</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Explosive Device</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://thewesleys.bandcamp.com/album/explosive-device" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Last month Montreal quartet <a href="https://thewesleys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Wesleys</a> issued <em>Explosive Device</em>, a four-song EP that finds the garage-pop unit shuffling the deck, both in regards to their songwriting and lead vocalists.

The label has a limited run of 100 home-dubbed tapes available, complete with xeroxed J-cards. It&#39;s the classic no-budget DIY aesthetic, and probably the truth. Nothing else would be appropriate.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1270830601/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/album/money-fetish">Money Fetish by Low Blow</a></iframe> </body></html> </div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2025-11-10-amaro/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Amaro"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Amaro</div> <div class=pagination-date>November 10, 2025</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

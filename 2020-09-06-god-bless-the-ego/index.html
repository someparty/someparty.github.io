Based now in Montreal, Joe announced the launch of <a href="https://www.celluloidlunch.com/" class="" target=_blank>Celluloid Lunch Records</a>, an extension of his year-old fanzine of the same name. As the label&#39;s first release, Joe&#39;s debuted a new musical project dubbed <a href="https://itchyself.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Itchy Self</a>, with an EP titled <em>Here&#39;s The Rub</em> due on October 2. Citing The Saints, the Rats, and Neon Boys as inspiration, the fledgling label commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Drawing influence from the looser end of the Ork records catalogue, the sensitive side of Ohio&#39;s proto-punk scene and the grittiest and most sluggish tangent of 70&#39;s power pop, Itchy Self&#39;s debut 12&quot; is an exploration of fully formed songs treated with spontaneous delivery. The group got together in early 2020 for 3 practices and a recording session and here are the results, laid out in their raw form. This is cross-generational racket n roll music that wears its heart on its loosey goosey sleeve.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The group features Chamandy on guitar and vocals, Scott Brown on bass, Chris Burns on guitar, and Zak Slax on drums. Moss Lime&#39;s <a href="https://helenebarbier.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hélène Barbier</a> sings backup, along with Kay Moon (Dead Beat Poet Society) and <a href="http://preoccupationsband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Preoccupations</a>&#39; Scott Munro. Munro recorded the five-song set, with mastering performed by Mikey Young of the Eddy Current Suppression Ring and Total Control.</p><p>The single &quot;God Bless The Ego&quot; is streaming now at Bandcamp, with a video directed by <a href="https://equivoc.org/" class="" target=_blank>Équivoc</a>&#39;s Olivia Faye Lathuillière now playing at <a href="https://youtu.be/IIZkgB_OgGw" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a>.</p><p>Protruders last released <em>Poison Future</em> in 2019 on <a href="https://feelitrecords.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Feel It Records</a>.

From the sea. In the end of eternity, The white horse Carries no saint, no world saviour, The white horse roams free in its spectacular Human-less liberty as the aspiration of its destiny. Empty chariots, hidden in green vines, hill-like and indistinguishable from the world&#39;s eye — the rotting fossil of the gods. There is a white horse, roaming in the green eye-shade, In a new dawning hour, through a mad reverie, bore the eyes of the kingdom, green eye-shade, In the fall of all power, rose a clear alchemy of green eye-shade.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track will be part of the 11-song LP when it arrives from <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> on September 18. The Outfit features Romano backed by vocalist Julianna Riolino, guitarist/vocalist David Nardi, bassist Roddy Rossetti, and drummer Ian Romano, with guest contributions from pianist Mark Lalama, vocalist Briana Salmena, sax player Victor Belcastro, and Aaron Hutchinson on trumpet. The new single follows &quot;A Rat Without a Tale&quot; in previewing the set.</p><p><em>How Ill Thy World Is Ordered</em> is the 9th fully-realized release from Romano this calendar year, but only the second you can hold in your hands (following the pre-pandemic live record, <em>&quot;Okay Wow&quot;</em>). Over the isolation era, and for a stint on a near-weekly basis, Danny somehow churned out more music than most bands release in their entire careers. You can explore that whole collection (which, come to think of it, would make a meaningful boxed set to commemorate this otherwise lost year) over at <a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7mAhvjvWHcA" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/7mAhvjvWHcA" class="black no-underline fw4 db tc f6 nt3 mb4" target=_blank>Watch: Daniel Romano&#39;s Outfit - &quot;Green Eye Shade&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Cerebral and angsty, the Whitehorse rock band <a href="https://cryptozoologists.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Cryptozoologists</a> has returned with a dynamic new full-length out titled <em>Pond Life</em>. Project lead Zach McCann-Armitage commented on the roots of the 11-song work:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;While writing the bulk of these songs, I was doing a lot of collaging. At first it was just a goofy pastime, but then, inspired by my growing collection of Home Hardware paint swatches, I decided to make a collage Tarot deck.</p><p>I got really excited about clashing Tarot&#39;s seriousness and mysticism with collage&#39;s beautiful, fragmenting irreverence. My songs try to do that too - the clash of the absolute sincerity and intensity of poetry with the humour and absurdity of believing that what you&#39;re doing is so important even though no one is listening that deeply.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>McCann-Armitage crafted these songs at Old Crow Recording with engineer Patrick Hamilton (<a href="https://sodapony.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Soda Pony</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheSweetiesMusic/" class="" target=_blank>The Sweeties</a>). The vocalist builds these tracks around his distinctively vulnerable, half-spoken storytelling, mixing live instrumentation with a smattering of electronics. The press release lists bookish, poetical artists like Destroyer and Wolf Parade among this project&#39;s influences, which seems entirely appropriate.</p><p>Cryptozoologists last released <em>Songs for Losers</em> in 2017, although they took part in the <em>Beneath The Broadcast</em> audio-visual series highlighting Yukon artists last year.

You can check out &quot;Bird Dog&quot; now through a visualizer by director Stephen Dutcheshen. This song&#39;s unique among the record&#39;s material in that it features mixing by producer Sylvia Massy, whose vast discography includes records by Tool, Prince, Johnny Cash, and Tom Petty. The band commented on working with her on this track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Her track record speaks for itself and her name is on the credits for a ton of albums we listen to. She understood the essence of the song from the first note and then took that version and ran it through a wash of countrified psychedelic haze.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Keeper</em> is due September 18 from <a href="http://sixshooterrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Six Shooter Records</a>. The 10-song full-length features studio engineering by Daryl Neudorf (Neko Case) with Ryan Hadlock (The Gossip, The Lumineers) mixing. Elliott BROOD last released <em>Ghost Gardens</em> in 2017 on <a href="https://paperbagrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Paper Bag Records</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5i4k_F51NqQ" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/5i4k_F51NqQ" class="black no-underline fw4 db tc f6 nt3 mb4" target=_blank>Watch: Elliott BROOD - &quot;Bird Dog&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>This October, <a href="http://yeahrightrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Yeah Right!

This past go-around saw Toronto hardcore luminaries <a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a> unearth a live recording from the legendary New York punk venue CBGB. The matinee show, recorded from the soundboard on May 29, 2006, took place in the final year of the space (it closed in October of that year). The time capsule finds the band amid a US tour before the release of <em>Hidden World</em>, their debut full-length. The band wrote about the experience:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We&#39;ve all got to believe in &#39;2006&#39; at some point or another in our lives. I thought it might have simply come and gone, but it turns out the bottomless vaults of our archive have provided a brief wormhole into its existence. In this version you could find remarkable feats of analogue musical participation flowing freely through space in the big wide cities of the big wide world. It was the land before guitar tuners, tempo checks, backing vocals, or monitor mixes. It was the time in which we all etched one phrase into our minds as young impressionable musicians finding their way on this earth: &#39;Nice set dude, can we borrow your amps.&#39;</p><p>We were on &#39;tour&#39; -- whatever that is -- and had a few gigs under our belt on the East Coast before we met up with what was THE tour to meet up with that spring: The Forward/Warhead/Tragedy &#39;Burning Against Spirits&#39; Tour. Titans of hardcore punk in 2006 collided across the US and for one last waltz, with us as well.</p><p>We waited patiently as Mind Eraser tore a hole through the fabric of the universe; while Kill your Idols created a brickwall of human bodies; while Forward tantalized and impressed with otherworldly precision; while Warhead left a scorch mark where the stage at CBGBs was; while Tragedy provided their indelible mark on that moment... and somewhere in the evening there was Fucked Up. That&#39;s what you&#39;re listening to. That&#39;s what you get. This is what we were capable of in the flesh in 2006, our 2006. That moment in time with its open doors and new pathways, all its ear piercing hearing loss perfection, all its potential, and it&#39;s absurd amount of nacho chips.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a> last released <em>Dose Your Dreams</em> on <a href="https://arts-crafts.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Arts &amp; Crafts</a> in Canada and <a href="https://www.mergerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Merge</a> elsewhere.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3894704126/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://fuckedup.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-cbgbs">Live at CBGB's by Fucked Up</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://fuckedup.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-cbgbs" class="black no-underline fw4 db tc f6 nt3 mb4" target=_blank>Listen: Fucked Up - <em>Live at CBGB&#39;s</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2020-09-13-colourful/" rel=next title="Next article: Colourful"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Colourful</div> <div class=pagination-date>September 13, 2020</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2020-08-30-canadian-dreams/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Canadian Dreams"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Canadian Dreams</div> <div class=pagination-date>August 30, 2020</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

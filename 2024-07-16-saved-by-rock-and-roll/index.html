The twelve-song collection spans a double LP set, showcasing material the Guelph singer-songwriter crafted in the last five years of his life. You can preview the record now through the prophetically named single &quot;Saved By Rock and Roll.&quot; Described by the label as an &quot;eerie and ambiguous dirge,&quot; the track finds the artist accompanied by a haunting arrangement of organ, accordion, and a backing choir. An ailing Laviolette&#39;s declaration that &quot;a little destruction will make you whole&quot; resonates as a powerful statement of purpose.</p><p>The label reveals that Laviolette wrote and recorded <em>All Wild Things Are Shy</em> in the period between his mother&#39;s death from Huntington&#39;s Disease and his own. Before recording, a new backing band coalesced in 2021, with Laviolette backed by Ally Corbett on viola, Dave Snider on bass, Jordan Howard and Matt Reeves on guitar, <a href="https://richburnett.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Rich Burnett</a> on drums, and longtime collaborator Jessy Bell Smith on vocals. That outfit debuted live in the summer of 2022, wrapping their run in September of that year when Laviolette&#39;s symptoms had advanced to the point where he could no longer perform live. Under that shadow, recording took place at <a href="http://www.scottmerritt.com" class="" target=_blank>Scott Merritt</a>&#39;s Guelph studio (&quot;the CottaGe&quot;) starting in January of last year. The label shed some light on those sessions:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Richard thought there would be more records after this one, but what was planned as a few weeks of recording soon became a slower and longer process. As with much of his earlier work, the songs on this album confront death and mortality, while also affirming love, life, and a fundamental belief in the ability of music to bring people together. Richard tinkered with each of the arrangements, working to eliminate anything that was not essential, creating an immediate and direct presentation of the songs, in his unique vision of rock music.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Saved By Rock and Roll&quot; features Rich Burnett drumming, Dave Snider on bass, Tyson Brinacombe on guitar, and Meredith Grant on accordion, with more than a dozen friends appearing in the choir. <a href="http://theconstantines.wordpress.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constantines</a>&#39; <a href="https://brywebb.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Bry Webb</a> and <a href="https://cotsmusic.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Cots</a>&#39; <a href="https://stephyates.com" class="" target=_blank>Steph Yates</a> share lead vocals on the album&#39;s title track. Burnett also helped mix the record.</p><p>With symptoms rapidly accelerating, Richard Laviolette chose to receive medical assistance in dying on September 5, 2023.</p><p>To celebrate the release, Laviolette&#39;s backing band will perform <em>All Wild Things Are Shy</em> at a series of upcoming shows, joined by a rotating cast of guest vocalists drawn from the artist&#39;s circle of peers. These kick off with an August 1 date at Montreal&#39;s Bar Le Ritz PDB with Lisa Conway, Andrew Collins, Sarah Mangle, Emma Moss Brender, Cedric Noel, and Michael Feuerstack. On August 3, the group plays <a href="http://www.sappyfest.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sappyfest</a> in Sackville, joined by Simone Schmidt, Julie Doiron, Klarka Weinwurm, Steve Haley, C.L. McLaughlin, Steven Lambke, Mathias Kom, Ariel Sharratt, and Colleen Collins. A September 6 performance at Toronto&#39;s Tranzac features Abigail Lapell, Jiaqing Wilson-Yang, Peter Demakos, Geordie Gordon, Tamara Lindeman, Terra Lightfoot, and José Contreras. On September 15, the band will convene with Scott Merritt, Jenny Mitchell, Nate Coles, and Claire Whitehead at the Guelph Jazz Festival. The tour wraps with an October 10 performance at Owen Sound&#39;s Heartwood Hall, the same venue as the group&#39;s first performance with Richard in 2021.</p><p>Richard Laviolette last issued <em>Taking The Long Way Home</em> in 2017 on You&#39;ve Changed.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1994392711/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://richardlaviolette.bandcamp.com/album/all-wild-things-are-shy">All Wild Things Are Shy by Richard Laviolette</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=real_rejects><span class=artist-title><a href="https://aliensnatch.bandcamp.com/album/real-rejects-not-allowed" class="" target=_blank>Real Rejects</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Not Allowed</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://aliensnatch.bandcamp.com/album/real-rejects-not-allowed" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Moncton provocateur <a href="https://tjcabot.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>TJ Cabot</a> is back with a new band, the <a href="https://aliensnatch.bandcamp.com/album/real-rejects-not-allowed" class="" target=_blank>Real Rejects</a>. The group&#39;s debut full-length, <em>Not Allowed</em>, arrives this week through <a href="https://aliensnatch.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Alien Snatch! Records</a>. The German label&#39;s issuing band&#39;s nine-song debut as a 10&quot; record pressed at 45 RPM in various colours.</p><p>The label&#39;s exuberant writeup touts <em>Not Allowed</em> as the &quot;flash bang party of 2024,&quot; channelling such pillars of garage and proto-punk as the Pagans, Stooges, and the Flamin&#39; Groovies. The blown-out album-opening title track certainly makes that case, an ever-accelerating mission statement underscored by a raucous organ (the label can&#39;t resist drawing lines from those keys to Sam the Sham &amp; the Pharaohs).</p><p>Cabot, otherwise known as Tyler Boutilier, has roots in several Maritime punk acts, including the <a href="https://phonejerks.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Phone Jerks</a> and <a href="https://nervebutton.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nerve Button</a>.

Cell Deth features Brett Sanderson and Ryan Kirkpatrick, formerly of <a href="https://antibodieschtn.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Antibodies</a>.

Matt&#39;s also known for the defunct PEI hardcore act <a href="https://acousmahc.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Acousma</a>, while Story&#39;s more recently fronted the indie trio <a href="https://coycoycoy.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Coy</a>.</p><p>Cell Deth recorded <em>Catholic Guilt</em> in 2023 at Ralphs Ranch, with Sanderson engineering. Dan Randall mastered at Mammoth Sound. The new EP follows the band&#39;s demo from the fall of 2022.

The band&#39;s David Hathaway commented on finally capturing their live energy on tape:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Roots Round Up has always been more about the live shows than the recorded output, but capturing that in a recording has proved elusive. The live songs were captured at our first full show after the pandemic had settled down, and we were more than a little excited to be playing again. Especially on Denman Island where we have played many times over the years. We had gotten an audio feed from Chris Wardman&#39;s mix of the show and as we listened back the next day, we thought &#39;wait a minute… this came out well!&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can find the single &quot;Relief&quot; captured in a new video. While the song grapples with war and addition, it wraps those serious topics in a wonderfully soulful, horn-adored package of second-wave-style ska.</p><p>The band&#39;s current lineup features vocalist/guitarist Greg Hathaway, vocalist/trombonist David &quot;Dymitri&quot; Hanna, guitarists David Hathaway and Mark Campbell, bassist Keith Rose, keyboardist Eric Napier, and drummer Bradford Lambert. Roots Round Up came together in 1985 from Vancouver&#39;s early punk scene. The group was a staple of Canada&#39;s touring circuit throughout the late 80s and early 90s but hasn&#39;t released anything new in decades. The band collected select recordings from 1986 through 1993 on the <em>Rootrospective</em> compilation during the 3rd wave boom.

Records</a>. The new set delivers thirteen original tracks.</p><p>The label forefronts the band&#39;s clear devotion to the classic swagger of the Stones, Slade, and Paul Collins&#39; Beat, promising a decadent take on 70s glam played at punk velocity (Dangereens actually opened for the Beat just this past February as part of the Taverne Tour). Their writeup boasts of &quot;wonderful 60s harmonies, 70s schmaltz rock with pounding 50s Berry kicks and relentless piano hammering.&quot;</p><p>The new record follows the group&#39;s 2020-issued debut <em>Tough Luck</em> and subsequent two-song single &quot;Lucky in Love&quot;/&quot;Holy Water.&quot;</p><p>Befitting their throwback trappings, the band had <em>Chic</em> analog mastered. It arrives on Alien Snatch packaged in a fuzzy inside-out gatefold sleeve, which also feels thematically apt but sounds bound to get gross over time.

The album finds the trio melding surfy garage rock with metal, punk, psych, and stoner rock fragments — an acerbic sound further filtered through Homa Khoshnavaz&#39;s background in traditional Persian scales.</p><p>Gadfly grew from bedroom recording experiments in Khoshnavaz&#39;s home of Tehran. After relocating to Vancouver in winter 2018, she assembled Gadfly with drummer Nigel Young and bassist Raine Menard. Together, they&#39;ve produced a grungy, hard-driven sound fueled by the artist&#39;s frustration over the treatment of women back home.</p><p>Shaun Thingvold produced <em>SURA</em> at Vancouver&#39;s Armoury Studios, with Jess Schmidt engineering.

The set finds the artist pivoting back to darkwave and gothic rock, crafting what he describes as &quot;meditations... confronting the commodification of our lives and the relentless demand for more.&quot; In a statement, Brown muses on the outcome of a society where we&#39;ve outlived our economic usefulness, commenting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;...what will become of us when we can no longer sell ourselves? How will our overlords deal with us if we outlive our use, and refuse to let go? Dispatches from the discarded, slick with oil used to expedite our exile.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new material follows a 2021 single that paired the atmospheric noise piece &quot;Flamma&quot; with the new wave tune &quot;Stuck.&quot; Cult Message first surfaced publically in 2020 as part of the pandemic-era online event DemoFest.</p><p>Micah Brown is best known for fronting the emo-influenced power-pop act <a href="https://pillea.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Pillea</a>, who issued the eight-song <em>Swell</em> in May of 2021 through <a href="https://linktr.ee/SunEaterRecords" class="" target=_blank>Sun Eater Records</a>.

Ascenico has since left the band, and they&#39;ve enlisted <a href="https://priorsmtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>PRIORS</a>&#39; Alan Hildebrandt to fill out their low-end. The group recorded with Ryan Battistuzzi (Taxi Girls, Hood Rats, Conditions Apply) engineering and Mikey Young mastering.</p><p>Cummins commented on the band&#39;s origins and decidedly unhip aspirations:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The band was mainly put together to escape the job doldrums, it wasn&#39;t until we decided to record four songs at Le Stuzzio with Ryan Battistuzzi that provoked a surprisingly positive reaction from our friends that we decided we would turn into an actual band and do an entire record... Montreal has a very large experimental scene (Godspeed! You Black Emperor, Colin Stetson, Tim Hecker etc.) and although we love that music, we are sort of reacting against it as we believe everybody can appreciate a good pop song.... We want to be as inclusive as possible and be the band that can bring entertainment back to small stages and DIY spaces again.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3loniPllWs?si=85LHQa68LYGwi4ca" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=the_drew_thomson_foundation><span class=artist-title><a href="https://drewthomson.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Drew Thomson Foundation</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Black Jeep&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://drewthomson.bandcamp.com/track/black-jeep" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://drewthomson.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Drew Thomson</a>&#39;s namesake pop-rock outlet <a href="https://drewthomson.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Drew Thomson Foundation</a> recently issued &quot;Black Jeep,&quot; a wistful love song that makes for an easy summer listen.

The track follows May&#39;s &quot;Connecting&quot; and finds Adam Sturgeon (<a href="https://statusnonstatus.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Status/Non-Status</a>) and Daniel Monkman (<a href="https://zoongideewinmusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Zoon</a>) further exploring their contemplative &quot;moccasin gaze&quot; sound.</p><p>&quot;Ziibi&quot; translates to &quot;river&quot; in Anishinaabe. It&#39;s a subtly layered track that gains in power and volume as it builds, not unlike its namesake. Monkman revealed that he wrote the song about Manitoba&#39;s Red River, reflecting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#39;s a very long river all the way from the Mississippi. I grew up along the shore of that river looking into it. Watching as it would swallow up all our bikes and skateboards. My first realization of how powerful the elements are... The river teaches us.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band builds &quot;Ziibi&quot; from layered acoustic guitars that crescendo to &quot;electric, emotional heights.&quot; Lyrically, the band wrestles with the constraints external forces place on Indigenous identity. They sing, &quot;Scared to leave / what is a reservation / Name and numb us instead / without a home.&quot;</p><p>These new songs follow OMBIIGIZI&#39;s Polaris-shortlisted 2022 debut <em>Sewn Together</em> and last year&#39;s standalone single &quot;Back at Me&quot; (a collaboration with Peter Dreimanis of <a href="https://www.julytalk.com/" class="" target=_blank>July Talk</a>).

The record, due August 23 through <a href="https://watchthatendsthenight.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Watch That Ends The Night</a> (a new label co-founded by Duguay and <a href="https://newhermitage.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>New Hermitage</a> saxophonist Andrew MacKelvie), promises an ambitious fusion of Americana, experimental rock, and rootsy atmospherics. The artist describes the album&#39;s sound as &quot;experimental heartland totalism,&quot; explained in a press release as &quot;an amalgam of sounds that recontextualizes aspects of Americana amidst more atmospheric and abstract elements.&quot;</p><p><em>Succeeder</em> grew from a pandemic-era songwriting exercise, in which Duguay composed pieces about every place he&#39;d ever lived. The project ultimately coalesced around songs tied to his formative years in Peterborough, with recording fittingly taking place in that city&#39;s All Saints Anglican Church. The sessions found Duguay backed by a nine-piece ensemble of local collaborators, as coordinated by <a href="https://thatjoyfulsound.tumblr.com/music" class="" target=_blank>Joyful Joyful</a>&#39;s Cormac Culkeen. Despite the rustic roots, the album notably eschews acoustic guitar in favour of winds, brass, and assorted folk instruments, including Duguay&#39;s trademark accordion. This is all in service of evoking &quot;the nocturnal sounds of coming of age in Peterborough: bar bands, rural fields, late-night kitchen parties, many voices joined in song.&quot;</p><p>The new record follows 2020&#39;s <em>The Winter Of Our Discotheque</em>, an LP on which the artist candidly addressed struggles with mental health, addiction, and homelessness. It also arrives after the curious disappearance of <em>Saint Maybe</em>, Duguay&#39;s initially publicized third album. Now free from the frustrations that ultimately benched that work, Duguay&#39;s holding <em>Succeeder</em> up as an &quot;affirmation of working on one&#39;s own terms and with one&#39;s own resources.&quot;</p><p>The label&#39;s celebrating the release with a listening party on August 22, the day before the album drops. Fans can listen online via Bandcamp or attend in person at Take Cover Books in Peterborough.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=412859275/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://michaelcloudduguay.bandcamp.com/album/succeeder">Succeeder by Michael Cloud Duguay</a></iframe> </body></html> </div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2024-08-07-les-olympiques/" rel=next title="Next article: Les Olympiques"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Les Olympiques</div> <div class=pagination-date>August 7, 2024</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2024-07-10-latest-pull/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Latest Pull"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Latest Pull</div> <div class=pagination-date>July 10, 2024</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

Each of these tracks is, for the most part, under 30 seconds in length and built around lyrics sent in by friends from around the world. The set clocks in at 12 minutes in total.

Titled <em>Songs From a (Social) Distance</em>, the set showcases a number of the label&#39;s acts along with a few spiritually aligned counterparts from across Canada. The organization commented on the 15 song set:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In spite of living in an increasingly compartmentalized world we&#39;ve decided that there is no better time than now to rally the community together and share some music with everyone. This is just a small sample of the incredible talent we have in Toronto and abroad, so please continue to support artists any way you can as they release new material during these complex times.</p><p>Many of us have been hit incredibly hard financially right now, so with that in mind we&#39;ve made this compilation free to download. Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy, we&#39;re looking forward to the day we&#39;ll all be able to enjoy music again together in the same space!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Among the tracklist, you&#39;ll find one of the first publically released songs from <a href="https://boilinghell.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Boiling Hell</a>, the new solo project from Ryan Naray of the Toronto post-punk group <a href="https://animalfaces.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Animal Faces</a>.

Like so many projects debuting in these times, the appropriately titled <em>Apocalyptic Rock</em> serves as a reaction to our newfound isolation. Menard commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I&#39;ve been writing some tunes for a few months now and planned on recording in the spring to have something legit out by summer, but then I was told not to leave my house and recorded an EP myself.

You can now stream the first two tracks from the gruff rock outfit&#39;s upcoming debut at Bandcamp. That release carries the title <em>Liquor, Leather, Denim &amp; Darts</em>, four words that sum up the Ciggie sound and overall ethos better than any genre could. The group wrapped these songs up right before the pandemic put the world on hold. They commented on their timing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Hot god Almighty, we were fortunate enough to wrap up our recording sessions just as this doomsday scenario began to unfold.</p><p>I have it on good authority that a bizarre cult have emerged in New Brunswick claiming these recordings are directly responsible for this plague sweeping across the globe. I won&#39;t speak to these rumours as they are largely unfounded. We have no tentative date for a release of our earth shattering debut but in an extreme act of generosity wanted to gift you shut ins with a little dose of Rock n Roll. Because one thing is for certain at a time like this we all need Rock n Roll.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Ciggie &amp; The Darts features members of <a href="https://chloroforming.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Chloroform</a>, <a href="https://slumlord.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Slumlord</a>, and <a href="https://alcoholfueled1.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Alcohol Fueled</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1340077050/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://ciggieandthedarts.bandcamp.com/album/liquor-leather-denim-darts">Liquor, Leather, Denim &amp; Darts by Ciggie &amp; The Darts</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://ciggieandthedarts.bandcamp.com/album/liquor-leather-denim-darts" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Ciggie &amp; The Darts - &quot;Struttin&#39;&quot; / &quot;Cosmonaut&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Halifax singer-songwriter <a href="https://jonmckiel.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jon Mckiel</a> has a new video online showcasing &quot;Object Permanence,&quot; the lead single from his upcoming LP <em>Bobby Joe Hope</em>. The surreal clip from director Andrea Thorne features a collage of psychedelic imagery. A likewise suitably oblique statement commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Magic recombines ordinary objects to wake us; acknowledge mystery. Pluck from the landscape a rose or a bruise. World forms and unforms in universe around us - a moment comes and then dissolves. Tides and life; on the shore let us embrace beneath Moon and tremble a little as lovers and kin while we tumble through time in the wandering place.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Bobby Joe Hope</em> follows up on Mckiel&#39;s 2017 LP <em>Memorial Ten Count</em>. It features found-audio salvaged from a second-hand reel-to-reel recorder and incorporated into each of the album&#39;s nine tracks. Mckiel worked in the studio with <a href="https://joyfultalk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>JOYFULTALK</a>&#39;s Jay Crocker on the project. <em>Bobby Joe Hope</em> arrives on April 24 from <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yWZBHSQNEZM" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/yWZBHSQNEZM" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Jon Mckiel - &quot;Object Permanence&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Jon Mckiel, along with poet Geordie Miller, performs from time to time as part of the Sackville-rooted <a href="http://www.sappyfest.com/flour" class="" target=_blank>Flour</a>.

All proceeds from the new record are to be donated to the World Health Organization&#39;s COVID-19 Response Fund. You can follow Real Sickies&#39; daily video updates of their progress now at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/therealsickies/">Facebook</a>.</p><p>This effort arrives on the heels of a new video for the song &quot;Yeah You,&quot; a track from the group&#39;s recent <a href="https://stomprecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stomp</a> debut, <em>Out of Space</em>.

Directed by musician and visual artist <a href="https://ambluteau.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>André M. Bluteau</a>, the video pairs the audio from <em>Le Mal</em>&#39;s &quot;Your World is my Mystery Gift II&quot; with a disjointed series of footage and stills. The song&#39;s lyrics (with some additional poetry) fade in and out, methodically overlaying the visuals in a manner that at times feels remarkably provocative. I&#39;m on record as a detractor of lyric videos in general, but this one is wonderfully nerve-wracking. It&#39;s deliberate to the point of being surgical. In a statement the band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Seeing this video made us realize that the song is not about now. It&#39;s about the future. The mystery. Whether good or bad, the current experience, and the potential outcome, resonates deeply with all of us&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Mystery Gift&quot; comes from the band&#39;s Polaris Music Prize shortlisted 2019 LP <em>Le Mal</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0XIhI1nFFi4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/0XIhI1nFFi4" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: FET.NAT - &quot;Your World Is My Mystery Gift II&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Jordy Bell of Capital punk acts <a href="https://thecreeps.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Creeps</a> and the <a href="https://crusades666.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Crusades</a> has a new solo project together.

The piece was created by band lead Benjamin Hackman during a composer&#39;s residency at the historic <a href="http://kievershul.com" class="" target=_blank>Kiever Synagogue</a> in Toronto&#39;s Kensington Market. In a press release, award-winning author Jacob Scheier commented on the piece:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>Mmm Urkh But</em> tells a story both familiar and original in style and content—Beckett-esque and biblical, ironic, absurd, yet genuine and poignant. One might think there is nothing left to say on the subject of communication in romance, or perhaps the impossibility of it, yet Hackman tackles the topic in a fresh and, at times, surprisingly delightful way.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The core of the work is a 16-minute spoken-word piece, with music composed by Hackman and Toronto composer Robert W. Stevenson. The recording features percussion from Hackman, with Stevenson performing on the bass clarinet. Given the current limitations on live performances, Hackman and company have been performing <em>Mmm Urkh But</em> several times over streaming services. Keep an eye on their socials for future engagements.</p><p>The Holy Gasp, as a full band, last released <em>The Love Songs of Oedipus Rex</em> in 2018.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=685958216/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://theholygasp.bandcamp.com/album/mmm-urkh-but">Mmm Urkh But by The Holy Gasp</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://theholygasp.bandcamp.com/album/mmm-urkh-but" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: The Holy Gasp - <em>Mmm Urkh But</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Ottawa&#39;s <a href="https://thetempunauts.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Tempunauts</a> are an instrumental act performing a mix of surf-driven numbers with psych and punk undertones.

The set showcases the wistful, Rob Labelle-penned &quot;The Game We Never Win&quot; and Rick Trembles&#39; comparatively oblique &quot;Interlarding.&quot; Their label celebrated the group&#39;s return (and their stubbornly enduring obscurity) with a self-deprecating note:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;...These two new tunes are the Devices in top form, widdled by time to the essential 4-part unit. Both songwriters deliver in their respective lanes, and the rhythm section kicks the can along with inventive gusto. In a warped world, American Devices&#39; oeuvre would be life-bending fodder for international bonehead punks, b-movie fanatics and prog nerds alike, but in this reality, they are banished to a profitless deal on the world&#39;s least respected underground record label. Lucky for us, misery loves company.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Celluloid Lunch has a pressing of 200 records available, wrapped in a Risograph-printed sleeve with a hand-stamped label. The set finds the band&#39;s core songwriting duo of Rob Labelle and Rick Trembles again backed by their modern-era rhythm section of bassist André Asselin and drummer Howard Chackowicz. The group recorded last year with Ian Booth at Studio Hot Biscuit. Harris Newman mastered at Greymarket. You can find a rather charming video for &quot;The Game We Never Win&quot; on YouTube.</p><p>The record carries a dedication to Carl Helm, the band&#39;s founding drummer who performed as Cups Von Helm. He passed away in the summer of this year.</p><p>American Devices launch the new single with a show this Thursday at Montreal&#39;s Sala Rossa. There, they&#39;ll share the stage with the aggressively erratic art-punk duo <a href="https://crabe.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Crabe</a>, with whom the band recently paired on the song &quot;2020.&quot; That collaboration appeared on CRABE&#39;s newly released LP <em>Visite du temple inné</em> (a guest-packed record that also features Annie-Claude Deschênes of <a href="https://duchesssays.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Duchess Says</a>, <a href="https://www.bellegrandfille.com/" class="" target=_blank>Belle Grand Fille</a>, <a href="https://nnao.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>N.NAO</a>, <a href="https://simoneprovencher.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Simone Provencher</a> of <a href="https://victimelol.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>VICTIME</a>, and <a href="https://hubertlenoir.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hubert Lenoir</a>). Rick Trembles shared some background on their pairing on Instagram, revealing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;[CRABE] asked us to come up with several separate riff cycles &amp; then recorded us playing them! They also asked me to make up a French story I could narrate over the end! Then they mixed everything together &amp; sang over it, creating THIS monster! And the cherr(ies) on top? Not only are we gonna interpret this thing live at the launch of our vinyls... but so are Crabe! Three interpretations in one night! The vinyl version that never existed live, then two different live versions! DO NOT MISS!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>If you&#39;ve not heard &quot;2020,&quot; it&#39;s available as part of CRABE&#39;s <em>Visite du temple inné</em> at <a href="https://crabe.bandcamp.com/album/visite-du-temple-inn" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a>, issued through the <a href="https://www.durevie.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Dure Vie</a> label.</p><p>All this new activity comes in the wake of Celluloid Lunch&#39;s 2022 unearthing of &quot;Adequate&quot; and &quot;Modern Boy,&quot; an unreleased 1979/1980 EP from the proto-Devices trio <a href="https://celluloidlunch.bandcamp.com/album/adequate-b-w-modern-boy" class="" target=_blank>The D-Vices</a>. The American Devices also recently made their career-spanning retrospective available online for the first time.

Judging from the album-opening &quot;Halberdier,&quot; the 10-song <em>Pain Behaviour</em> takes the band&#39;s industrial/goth fixation to entirely new levels of fidelity. Dense, mean, and sonically massive, the single feels world&#39;s removed from the pair&#39;s home-recorded, COVID-era beginnings. You can hear the harrowing new single, a tune rather ideally suited for this spookiest of months, accompanied by a video collage of live footage on YouTube.</p><p>Dermabrasion features Kat McGouran on vocals and bass with Adam Bernhardt on guitar and synths. The pair previously played together in the brilliant snark-punk act <a href="https://wlmrt.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>WLMRT</a>. Josh Korody recorded, produced, and mixed from Candle Recording with Noah Mintz mastering. Look for <em>Pain Behaviour</em> on January 26.

A quartet, the group features Lydia Champagne on drums, guitarists Jean-Philippe Fréchette (aka <a href="https://navetconfit.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Navet Confit</a>) and Jerry Lee Boucher, and bassist/vocalist/lyricist Jessica Pion. That sentence is likely a gross over-simplification of everyone&#39;s roles, as there&#39;s a swath of weird and wonderful instrumentation throughout the aurally busy LP. The quartet recorded this past January at the Sushi Cat Studio in Montreal, with Confit and Boucher handling production duties. I was a big proponent of <em>Sexe Étranger</em>, and this set, tightly wound, angular, and at times loud-as-hell, feels like a worthy follow-up.</p><p>You can find a hypnotic video for the track &quot;La comète ne pouvait être observée sur l&#39;île mais plusieurs vacanciers manquèrent de savoir-vivre&quot; on <a href="https://youtu.be/wdZVyWhZdyE?si=0GDrUH1PPl-VA1xU" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a>, directed by Lydia Champagne.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1089527140/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://nushu.bandcamp.com/album/n-shu">Nüshu by Nüshu</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=hot_garbage><span class=artist-title><a href="http://hotgarbagemusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Hot Garbage</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Snooze You Lose&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/XQHxdwjL20k?si=UgI8ImvjETINO1cl" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://hotgarbagemusic.bandcamp.com/album/precious-dream" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Heavy Toronto psych quartet <a href="http://hotgarbagemusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Hot Garbage</a> returns in the new year with <em>Precious Dream</em>, their sophomore full-length.

The news arrived alongside the single &quot;Snooze You Lose,&quot; a song that addresses &quot;how time passes when you stand still.&quot; It finds the band in a savage stomp punctuated by swirls of discordant noise and menacing laughter. You can see it envisioned on what&#39;s certainly a punk rock budget in a new video directed by the band&#39;s Alex Carlevaris. He comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Here Hot Garbage can be seen playing completely real instruments in their day-to-day attire. Seen in the video is: a live performance, a swing set, and a candid perspective of the daily grind. The video, with a budget of under $50 (mostly spent on fake blood), was shot on a cheap plastic toy camera and uses homemade props and movements from the camera and lights, resulting in a frantic, lo-fi presentation that is playful yet intense.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band again recorded with <a href="https://www.holyfuckmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Holy Fuck</a>&#39;s Graham Walsh at Palace Sound (bound to become an increasingly hot ticket given the producer&#39;s role on Debby Friday&#39;s Polaris-lauded <em>Good Luck</em>).

The heartfelt punk/emo unit has a new full-length dubbed <em>Invincible Summer</em> set for release on February 9. You can preview the set through the lead single &quot;Eviction Spree,&quot; a song rooted in the housing crisis that continues to grip much of the country. On it, Wayfarer principal Kyle Krische commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In the summer of 2021, real estate hit a historic high so we saw rentals getting bought up and long-term tenants evicted in every dirty way possible. We dubbed it the Eviction Spree in Hamilton.</p><p>The song &quot;Eviction Spree&quot; is a snapshot of a moment in time where my family experienced what sadly so many have the last few years: losing your stable affordable housing to unrelenting greed. It&#39;s so easy to break and to let your fury poison every aspect of your life. The stress and fear are all consuming when you&#39;re scrambling to figure out how to continue to provide a home for the ones you love.</p><p>Thankfully, I had an absolute rock in my wife, I had two children born at that house, I had work and I had support that would allow me to eventually land us on our feet. They were powerful forces that I could feed off of and thrive from and it was something in our earlier, relatively comfortable early years I didn&#39;t appreciate. I owed a nod to all of that and this was the result.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band recorded in the spring of 2023 at several studios, with Krische tackling lead vocals, drums, and rhythm guitar, Steve Sloane on lead guitar and vocals, and Duffer Black on bass. Davis Maxwell engineered, mixed and mastered the set. The new record follows up on 2019&#39;s <em>Reckless Spring</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3974459703/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://wayfarer.bandcamp.com/track/eviction-spree">Eviction Spree by Wayfarer</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=big_school><span class=artist-title><a href="https://bigschoolband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Big School</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Don&#39;t Cry I&#39;ll Be Right Back</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://bigschoolband.bandcamp.com/album/dont-cry-ill-be-right-back" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Rose City power-pop mainstays <a href="https://bigschoolband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Big School</a> issued a new full-length in September, a 10-song set dubbed <em>Don&#39;t Cry I&#39;ll Be Right Back</em>. A five-piece, the band features Mitch Courtois on vocals and guitars, bassist Codey Thompson, drummer Billy Topolinsky, and guitarists Riley Simpson and Drew Stark. Courtois recorded the group in Welland, with Alex Gamble (Fucked Up, Alvvays) mixing.

The band hasn&#39;t been overly chatty regarding these new tracks or their plans, leaving the work to speak for itself. These new tunes include &quot;Julia,&quot; &quot;Driveway,&quot; and most recently, &quot;Weatherman&quot; (which the band <em>did</em> refer to as &quot;a delicious slice of &#39;60s jangle pie,&quot; so we&#39;ve got that!).</p><p>While Hyness has undergone several configurations over the years, this era&#39;s focused on the songwriting duo of guitarist/vocalist Marcus Addams and drummer Colin White. Addams&#39; partner Amy also appears on vocals in &quot;Julia.&quot; The band&#39;s yet to reveal concrete plans for a new record, but wherever this Contreras-recorded material ends up, it&#39;ll follow up on 2021&#39;s <em>Settle Down In The Dirt</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1689041903/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://hyness.bandcamp.com/track/weatherman">Weatherman by Hyness</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=diamondtown><span class=artist-title><a href="https://diamondtown.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Diamondtown</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Future Plans</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://diamondtown.bandcamp.com/album/future-plans" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Dartmouth&#39;s blissed-out <a href="http://diamondtown.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Diamondtown</a> has a new cassette available. <em>Future Plans</em> delivers three new cuts of the band&#39;s melancholy folk/shoegaze hybrid, following up on September&#39;s <em>Hey</em> EP.

Titled <em>Show Friends</em>, the single&#39;s due October 31 through <a href="https://www.mergerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Merge</a>. In a statement, frontman Damian Abraham commented on the title track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is a song about the complex relationships people can wind up having with music and the music business. It&#39;s a very conditionally loving business, with all sorts of metrics and benchmarks you need to hit to deserve love. The lyrics are me reflecting back on one of the low times in the band and realizing that I&#39;m not really mentally cut out for this vocation. What happens when the thing you have based your life around starts eating you alive? I wanted it to have the feel of a mid-tour fever dream, replete with: anxiety, exhaustion, temporal dysplasia, and the flood of past wrongs and wrongings. I had written the lyrics during the <em>One Day</em> session but couldn&#39;t get it to come together like it sounded in my head. Jonah [Falco] and I dusted it off and hacked away at it in my basement until it felt right.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Show Friends</em> also features the new songs &quot;Spot The Difference&quot; and &quot;What The Sun Saw.&quot;</p><p>Fucked Up issued their ten-track <em>One Day</em> LP in January, followed by the <em>Cops</em> EP in April. To coincide with their cross-country summer tour, the band then issued a pair of covers recorded in collaboration with electric pow-wow duo <a href="https://thehallucination.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Halluci Nation</a>, later followed by a <a href="https://polarismusicprize.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Polaris Music Prize</a> cover session recreating the <a href="https://www.subpop.com/artists/erics_trip" class="" target=_blank>Eric&#39;s Trip</a> classic &quot;Sunlight.&quot; That audio surfaced amidst a rolling series of resurfaced mixtapes and reissues celebrating the tenth anniversary of <em>The Chemistry Of Common Life</em>.

The band&#39;s hooky second single from the set, &quot;Plastic Punx,&quot; recently premiered with a playful video that leans fully into the artifice the title suggests. In a statement, keyboardist/vocalist Jiffy Marx commented on the track and how it reflects the band&#39;s current outlook:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It seemed like right up to the day we started recording this album it might never happen, but not even being divided by an international border (during a global pandemic!) could get in our way, and I think we can all say we are glad it didn&#39;t. Like the song says, we&#39;re all Plastic Punx. Not hardcore punks, anarcho punks, gutter punks, or squeegee punks, but Plastic Punx. The kinda punks that don&#39;t give a fuck, especially about how much money we&#39;re getting at the show - as long as the venue isn&#39;t too far from the hotel, and the hotel is close to the skatepark and/or the beach.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The album is the band&#39;s first as a quartet with the addition of guitarist Lars Swenson, known from Seattle&#39;s <a href="https://www.breadandbutterrules.com" class="" target=_blank>Bread &amp; Butter</a> and Sub Pop act <a href="https://www.subpop.com/artists/the_catheters" class="" target=_blank>The Catheters</a>.

It&#39;s built around a driving post-punk instrumental paired with a few distinct vocal movements. The band&#39;s clearly put some thought into how to best utilize Marko Woloshyn&#39;s deadpan, half-spoken delivery, and he&#39;s given a lot to do here with some clever turns of phrase and more than a few engaging shifts in tempo. The song&#39;s greatest asset is that it&#39;s funny, or at least absurdist, while still tackling some heavy topics (addition, namely). That&#39;s a hard balance to strike, but the band never seems like they&#39;re taking the subject too lightly. It&#39;s clear that Bike Thiefs are mocking their narrator&#39;s bluster, not his underlying ailment, and it works.</p><p>Woloshyn, the band&#39;s vocalist and lead guitarist, commented on the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Hockey Dad&#39; is about a friend dealing with drug addiction. It&#39;s heartbreaking to see how polarizing, and frankly exhausting the experience for them (and the people that surround them) can be. They vacillate between feeling like they&#39;re king shit of asshole mountain or a has-been hockey dad trying to hold on to any semblance of past success. You watch as the drugs at times gives them the confidence to spin plates and hold court in crowds of strangers. At other times you watch the crippling anxiety start to dig paranoid foxholes into the middle of their box-spring. It feels like a tired topic, but there&#39;s an opioid crisis in North America, an inordinate amount of high functioning alcoholics and people being hand-fed pharmaceuticals as a band-aid solution to an incomprehensible depression. Maybe not a new idea, but maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s still important.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Bike Thiefs features Woloshyn alongside bassist Kris Pandierada and drummer Andrew Fasken. <a href="http://beliefsmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Beliefs</a>&#39; Josh Korody (The Dirty Nil, Dilly Dally) produced the track. The grammatically-challenged trio are following up their 2017 EP <em>Lean Into It</em>.</p><p>The band&#39;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/BikeThiefs/events/" class="" target=_blank>on the road</a> now. Look for them on tour throughout the U.S. for the next few weeks.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3490828300/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://bikethiefs.bandcamp.com/track/hockey-dad">Hockey Dad by Bike Thiefs</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://bikethiefs.bandcamp.com/track/hockey-dad" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Bike Thiefs - &quot;Hockey Dad&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Early last week, Vancouver&#39;s reunited <a href="https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Apollo Ghosts</a> released <em>Living Memory</em>, and while it&#39;s technically their first full-length in seven years (and the first since their reunion), it&#39;s a far cry from the jangly, lyrically playful indie rock the band&#39;s been known for. The instrumental <em>Living Memory</em> is an ambient, piano-driven work from frontman Adrian Teacher. In a statement (that you can read in full at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ApolloGhosts/posts/10156313969266174" class="" target=_blank>Facebook</a>), Teacher outlines the forces influencing the piece, drawing lines between his father&#39;s collapse into Alzheimer&#39;s, the death of BC&#39;s cedar forests (a result of climate change), and broader struggles tied up in the legacy of colonialism. In short:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Even though cedar trees are not my kin, I still feel despair because they&#39;re dying. I see them everywhere now, when I&#39;m out hiking or just walking around my neighborhood. This album is my attempt to manipulate the grief and despair I feel about climate change. If I can give it a form, maybe I can understand it. Maybe I can feel that grief, listen to it, set it aside briefly, and then try to take action.</p><p>Many of the songs are expressions of some of my most vivid memories of my father. If I can give those memories form, maybe I can relive them, engage with them, set them aside, and then appreciate the time with my father still left to me. Maybe, when my memory also fades, I can at least listen to the songs for a reminder of my memories of him.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Teacher recorded <em>Living Memory</em> over the past year, with Dave Carsell mixing the results. All proceeds raised from the sale of the album are due for the <a href="https://cpaws.org/" class="" target=_blank>Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society</a> and the <a href="http://unistoten.camp/support-us/donate/" class="" target=_blank>Unist&#39;ot&#39;en Legal Fund</a>. A video for the track &quot;Western Red Cedar,&quot; showcasing the trees&#39; decline, is also now online and linked up below.</p><p>While Apollo Ghosts have technically been inactive since the release of <em>Landmark</em> in 2012, Teacher&#39;s continued to put out music under a variety of names in the years since. His post-Ghosts acts included <a href="https://thenameofthisbandiscool.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>COOL TV</a>, <a href="https://adrianteacher.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Adrian Teacher and the Subs</a>, and <a href="https://arbutus.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Arbutus</a> (which is the closest in style to what you find on this record). In interviews addressing the band&#39;s recent reunion, Teacher commented that, while initially hesitant, he&#39;s since come around to embrace the Ghosts&#39; name and legacy. That explains why an intensely personal work like this has arrived as part of the Apollo Ghosts discography (and from that perspective, our most recent touchpoint shouldn&#39;t be <em>Landmark</em> at all, but instead the 2018 Subs record <em>Anxious Love</em>).</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jd7uwUM-WlA" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Jd7uwUM-WlA" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Apollo Ghosts - &quot;Western Red Cedar&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3386988840/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/album/living-memory">Living Memory by Apollo Ghosts</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/album/living-memory" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Apollo Ghosts - <em>Living Memory</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Last week the Toronto electronica group <a href="https://www.holyfuckmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Holy Fuck</a> detailed their next full-length, a 9-song set titled <em>Deleter</em>. It&#39;s due on January 16 from <a href="https://lastgang.com/" class="" target=_blank>Last Gang</a>.</p><p>The set includes the recently unveiled single &quot;Luxe,&quot; which we first got our hands on in September. You&#39;ll recall it featured guest vocals from Alexis Taylor of the English synthpop group Hot Chip. Holy Fuck made the announcement alongside the release of a new animated video for &quot;Luxe,&quot; created by Cynthia Alfonso and Óscar Raña. The band commented on the visuals in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;synesthesia is a big part of the creative process for us; deciding where to pan instruments, how to treat them in the mix, as well as the overall song writing process – you naturally connect it to the visual. It&#39;s then out of our hands the moment we ask someone else to handle artwork and videos. But that&#39;s the most interesting part... &#39;seeing&#39; how someone else sees it.</p><p>For the video, Cynthia and Oscar were able to take this visual world of <em>Deleter</em> to the next dimension, creating a world that feels a lot like the one we lived in when we were in the studio making the record. We love how they distort mundane, industrial, inanimate objects to create something emotional and organic... something so fundamentally human. In the process of bringing things to life, they make them either playful or dangerous. Everything&#39; off-gases.&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Holy Fuck features Brian Borcherdt and Graham Walsh at the controls, backed by bassist Matt &quot;Punchy&quot; McQuaid and drummer Matt Schulz. They&#39;re following up 2016&#39;s full-length <em>Congrats</em> and the 2017 <em>Bird Brains</em> EP with this release. Along with Taylor, the new record features guest appearances from Angus Andrew of Brooklyn&#39;s Liars and Nicholas Allbrook of the Australian psyche duo Allbrook/Avery.</p><p>In a statement, Holy Fuck further commented on the album&#39;s themes, which address the convergence of humanity and the machines we&#39;ve built:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The robots are smarter than ever, and the algorithm knows more and more what we like as individuals, but we have to remind ourselves that there is music in the margins that can go missing and that that music is more important than ever.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6gP4IijTCM" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/I6gP4IijTCM" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Holy Fuck - Luxe (ft.

In the premiere at <a href="https://northerntransmissions.com/nutrients-release-new-video-for-such-slime/" class="" target=_blank>Northern Transmissions</a>, vocalist Taylor Teeple commented on the track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I wanted to write a song that could be someone&#39;s favourite, go-to song to do at karaoke in an alternate universe. Or maybe an alien karaoke party on another planet. I think the ballad-like intro and the climactic bridge both lend themselves well to a drunk person singing this song at a half-empty, dimly lit karaoke night. The title also works great with this pathetic karaoke crooner, bemoaning their identity as someone who is slimy and unattractive, as they slowly descend into sadness.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song arrived alongside a cool retro video from Isaac Roberts. Louise Short recorded &quot;Such Slime&quot; at Dining Room Sound last winter. The sax on the recording comes courtesy of <a href="http://na-o-mi.com/" class="" target=_blank>Naomi McCarroll-Butler</a> (not that it&#39;s her in the video, mind you, rather that&#39;s actress Bea Santos).</p><p>Nutrients are the outgrowth of a bedroom-pop project stated by Teeple while living in Montreal. Now operating out of Toronto, his band features guitarist Will Hunter, drummer Turner Wigginton, bassist Sean McKee, and keyboardist Iulia Ciobanu.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lz8eTCDY1d0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Lz8eTCDY1d0" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Nutrients - &quot;Such Slime&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>I&#39;m admittingly pretty ignorant of <a href="https://louis-philippegingras.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Louis-Philippe Gingras</a>&#39; career to date, and the machine translations of <a href="https://www.simonerecords.net/" class="" target=_blank>Simone Records</a>&#39; French-language press material are providing me with little more than florid gibberish. So context or subtleties aside, I&#39;m entirely on-board with &quot;Barrés d&#39;Toronto.&quot; The joyous folk-rock tune&#39;s the second single from singer-songwriter&#39;s upcoming record <em>Tropicale Apocalypse</em>, the third full-length from the Abitibi-bred, now Montreal-based musician. It follows the Caribbean-flavoured &quot;Apocalypso,&quot; which premiered in August.</p><p>That the song details a road trip from <a href="http://www.fmeat.org/" class="" target=_blank>FME</a>&#39;s Rouyn-Noranda to my hometown of Niagara Falls is just icing on the cake. I&#39;m a sucker for geography in my Cancon, local in particular. To top it off, the song features a delightfully silly steel drum bridge and a delightful children&#39;s choir. <em>Tropicale Apocalypse</em> is due in November.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=159946637/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://louis-philippegingras.bandcamp.com/track/barr-s-dtoronto">Barrés d'Toronto by Louis-Philippe Gingras</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://louis-philippegingras.bandcamp.com/track/barr-s-dtoronto" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Louis-Philippe Gingras - &quot;Barrés d&#39;Toronto&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Four-piece Vancouver post-punk group <a href="https://championlawnmower.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Champion Lawnmower</a> has returned with a new self-titled full-length.

They&#39;re going to be more than okay – they&#39;re going to be great.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new single follows the Miesha &amp; The Spanks&#39;s 2018 full-length <em>Girls Girls Girls</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=300 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/681029303&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" class=lazyload></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mandthespanks/the-girls-are-ok" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Miesha &amp; The Spanks - &quot;The Girls Are O.K.&quot; @ SoundCloud</a></p><p>The Vancouver post-punk group <a href="https://actors.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>ACTORS</a> recently saw one of their singles remixed by the long-running BC synthwave artist <a href="https://fmattack.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>FM Attack</a>. &quot;Slaves&quot; originally appeared on 2018&#39;s <a href="http://artoffact.com/" class="" target=_blank>Artoffact Records</a> full length <em>It Will Come To You</em>.

The group brings together musicians from Costa Rica, France, and Quebec to find common ground in snotty, 77&#39; style punk. Imagine The Briefs playing classic Chuck Berry riffs. Something like that. The band&#39;s high energy new single features the anthem &quot;Red Guitar&quot; backed by &quot;Black Hands,&quot; available for preorder now from the upstart <a href="https://retarecords.bandcamp.com/album/red-guitar-ep" class="" target=_blank>Reta Records</a> on black or limited red wax. Reta&#39;s a relatively new label run by Jamie Rae of Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://palelips.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pale Lips</a>. You can stream both tracks at <a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/70984/stream-the-new-ep-from-montreal-trio-bambies" class="" target=_blank>Punknews</a>.</p><p>&quot;Red Guitar&quot; / &quot;Black Hands&quot; was recorded in Montreal by Matt Damron, with Harris Newman mastering. Sami, Franki and Feli of Bambies recently travelled to Mexico, where the band recorded 13 new songs with Diego Mier of Mexico City psych group <a href="https://buildavista.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Build a Vista</a>. That material is bound to show up on some future release that&#39;s yet to be announced.</p><p><a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/70984/stream-the-new-ep-from-montreal-trio-bambies" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Bambies - &quot;Red Guitar&quot; / &quot;Black Hands&quot; @ Punknews.org</a></p> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2019-10-13-lying-signal/" rel=next title="Next article: Lying Signal"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Lying Signal</div> <div class=pagination-date>October 13, 2019</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2019-09-29-evolve/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Evolve"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Evolve</div> <div class=pagination-date>September 29, 2019</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

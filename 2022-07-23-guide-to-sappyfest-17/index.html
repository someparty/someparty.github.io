The event takes place from July 29 through the 31st in the New Brunswick college town. Tickets are now available for the entire weekend or individual days through <a href="http://www.sappyfest.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>sappyfest.com</a>.</p><p class='maxread center'>In case you&#39;re wondering, this isn&#39;t a paid promotion. It&#39;s bordering more on an obsession - and perhaps an act of therapy. My pending trip to the East Coast is the first time I&#39;ll have ventured anywhere outside Ontario since the pandemic started, and I&#39;m overly anxious that I&#39;ll somehow mess it up and end up stuck in quarantine. This edition of Some Party is my talisman, warding off misfortune with Swamp Magic.</p><p class='maxread center'>Below you&#39;ll find a recap of the complete roster performing this year&#39;s event, a manageable number of artists to wrap your head around, given the sprawling lineups we see at bigger festivals. Some of these names are well-represented in the annals of Some Party, while others required a good deal of research. I feel better for doing it, as Sappy&#39;s small enough that you can embrace the tapestry of sounds without needing to pick and choose. Even if you&#39;re not attending - I suspect you&#39;ll find something of interest below. Sappy has an uncanny ability to create a sense of community independent of genre or stylistic preference, and this batch of artists exemplifies that.</p><p class='maxread center'><em>I&#39;ll also note two exclusive bits of content below.

While the latter struck close to the Vancouver band&#39;s scrappy indie rock template, it took several years for Teacher to feel right reassuming the old name (and not before seeking the blessing of his original-run bandmates). The revived Ghosts played 2019&#39;s Sappyfest, the first summer of their reunion - and it was electric. Adrian&#39;s a jubilant performer and delivered their entire set with a gleeful smile. I recall them paying into the Subs&#39; &quot;Hello Everyone,&quot; and the winking understatement in the opening line felt penned for the occasion: &quot;Hello everyone, thanks for coming out / We used to play here sometimes.&quot; Given everything that&#39;s happened, or didn&#39;t, these past few years, I could do with hearing that again.</p><p class='maxread center'>The group issued <em>Pink Tiger</em> in the spring of this year, a massive double LP boasting two distinct emotional journeys. The album sports a thematic split between its platters, with the A and B sides sharing &quot;an intimate home-recorded acoustic-based cycle that grapples with loss, illness, death, and memory.&quot; The latter half kicks into a higher gear, delivering &quot;an exuberant indie-garage rock celebration of the persistence of friendship, music, and hope.&quot; Those are quotes cribbed from the original <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed</a> press release, but they hold true.</p><p class='maxread center'>The band worked as a three-piece in the studio with producer Jordan Koop, with Teacher backed by longtime drummer Amanda P. and bassist Robbie N.

With <em>Hang Time</em>, issued last fall through <a href="https://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Joyful Noise</a> and the <a href="https://www.forwardmusicgroup.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Forward Music Group</a>, all those disparate styles seemed to coalesce. In these thirteen songs, years of experimentation reach a cohesive nexus, a unified form. <em>Hang Time</em> is so enviously confident in its craft yet delivered with such a relaxed use of space that it&#39;s easy to overlook the years of churn it took to get here.</p><p class='maxread center'>Noel recorded <em>Hang Time</em> primarily at Montreal studio The Pines with engineer Steve Newton, a space that wouldn&#39;t outlast the financial pressures of the pandemic. Liam O&#39;Neill of the atmospheric art-rock group <a href="https://suuns.bandcamp.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>SUUNS</a> came along for the ride, providing the album with a subtle rhythmic backbone.</p><p class='maxread center'><em>Hang Time</em> often directly engages with questions of race, identity, and belonging - grappling with Noel&#39;s personal history. A Black man adopted into a multi-racial family, he moved around the world before ending up at university in Fredericton, where he fell in with the city&#39;s predominantly white indie rock community. He revealed:</p><blockquote class="maxquote center pl4 black-60 bl bw2 b--red"><p class='maxread center'>&quot;In a sense I wrote this record for a teenage version of myself and hope that it reaches those who find themselves in similar situations that I was when writing the album.

Let&#39;s not forget that nimble singer/songwriter Mathias Kom vaporized an entire wedding once (see &quot;Canadian Wine&quot; from 2017&#39;s <em>Revival Beach</em>, an album that closed with the society-rebooting &quot;Supermoon&quot;). It&#39;s always done with a wry smile and a clever turn of phrase, though. These disasters often happen off-screen, with Kom more interested in cheerfully cataloguing and celebrating the messy human minutiae left in its wake. It&#39;s fitting that the band&#39;s first album since the pandemic quite literally revels in the trash: the 12-song <em>Garbage Island</em> addresses &quot;The End of the End of the World&quot; quite directly (although with a bit of an avian perspective).</p><p class='maxread center'>Given their proximity and history with the festival, The Burning Hell are Sappy regulars. Knowing that, I kept close tabs on their tour announcements this spring, satisfied to see the Sappy-shaped hole in their summer routing persist. Sometimes dreams come true, even mundane ones, and the group&#39;s indeed returning to the post-apocalyptic Bridge Street stage. While the band&#39;s lineup often shifts around its core of Mathias and Ariel Sharratt, this latest incarnation sees St John&#39;s multi-talented <a href="https://jakenicoll.bandcamp.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Jake Nicoll</a> play a prominent role. Nicoll spent his pandemic downtime building a solar-powered, mobile studio in the shell of a 70s-era camper. Look for that curiosity, which comes complete with a backline, analog recording rig, and even a tape duplicator, to be on hand at the festival. Christened the &quot;Phonoautomat,&quot; the band&#39;s opening the studio for attendees to record impromptu projects on-site at Sappy. The festival revealed:</p><blockquote class="maxquote center pl4 black-60 bl bw2 b--red"><p class='maxread center'>&quot;Step inside the Phonoautomat, grab a guitar or a microphone, and off you go for five minutes of live recording. Once you&#39;re finished, relax in the art lounge outside and craft your handmade album artwork while you wait for the engineer to finish mixing and duplicating your project. In less than 30 minutes from start to finish, you and your collaborators will have a sonic souvenir to cherish forever.</p><p class='maxread center'>Whether you&#39;re a professional musician and want to collaborate with other artists at a festival, get that sudden flash of inspiration down to tape instantly, or you have no musical experience whatsoever but always wanted to cut a single: the Phonoautomat is open to everyone.&quot;</p></blockquote><p class='maxread center'><em>Garbage Island</em>, itself mixed by Nicoll in the Phonoautomat, landed in June through <a href="https://bbislandmusic.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>BB*Island</a> and <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>.

I still have the match they slipped in the construction paper CD sleeve. There&#39;s a particular cohort of ex-punks who found their shit completely upended by the Three Gut roster, and I was one of them. Lambke&#39;s eclectic solo output (under his name or some permutation of Baby Eagle) ricochets between moments of undiluted poetry and onslaughts of guitar feedback. It&#39;s a loud/quiet dynamic that resonates throughout Steve&#39;s work, worldview, and politics.</p><p class='maxread center'>Just look at his statement regarding the single &quot;Every Lover Knows,&quot; which cycles through expressions of defiance and even rage, only to land somewhere truly centred and loving:</p><blockquote class="maxquote center pl4 black-60 bl bw2 b--red"><p class='maxread center'>&quot;The songs on Volcano Volcano were written as affirmations of a shared world. The world as it is. To affirm the reality and the great mutuality of the world, to experience the world through listening and breathing; to experience connections with different parts of the world, and relationships that feel like identification or understanding or participation or collaboration. And so it was written against the liars and politicians and corporations and police who say that life, your life, can be lived individually, on individually enclosed land, can be raised or punished individually, and outside the reckoning of history. Against the billionaires and their spaceships who imagine environmentally controlled existences on distant planets. As if no storms on Mars! Every Lover Knows is a song of celebration of experience as a teacher. The most profound moments in a life are often experiences of love, of connection, to another, to the world, to a shared moment. It is love that teaches the full scale of what can be experienced and of what can be lost.&quot;</p></blockquote><p class='maxread center'>His solo work aside, Steven Lambke&#39;s a community builder. <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>, his partnership with the iconoclastic <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a>, helped introduce the world to acclaimed acts like Partner, The Weather Station, and Nap Eyes.

Her May-released LP <em>Waves</em> was recently shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize - with a winner decided this September. Summer thus finds her in between worlds - surrounded by the friends and collaborators of her past and yet a dice roll from a whole new level of attention. I&#39;m confident saying that because McMichael writes the sort of timeless, psych-kissed pop-rock that could appeal to just about anyone, all they need is to hear it.

Doiron was still in the critical glow of <em>Lost Wisdom pt 2</em>, the heartwrenching sequel to her acclaimed 2008 collaboration with Mount Eerie. With these four players together at the peak of their powers there was every reason to be excited.</p><p class='maxread center'>It goes without saying that in March of 2020 we hit something of a global snag, and the eventual <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed</a> release <em>I Thought of You</em> in November of 2021 felt like the first sign of spring after a long pandemic winter. Julie&#39;s, of course, a revered figure in Canadian indie rock, and at Sappy in particular, but <em>I Thought of You</em> stands confidently on its own. Nostalgia&#39;s been a great comfort in these difficult years, but these songs feel rather masterful. The joyous opener &quot;You Gave Me The Key&quot; speaks to a new beginning and circles back to the refrain &quot;starting over again.&quot; It&#39;s tough to avoid projecting all sorts of unintended meaning onto lyrics like that, but given the times we&#39;re facing, we take what we can.</p><p class='maxread center'>Since that Polaris longlisted album, Doiron and Placard issued their debut LP as <a href="https://julieetdany.bandcamp.com" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Julie &amp; Dany</a> through <a href="https://www.simonerecords.net/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Simone Records</a>, a home-spun collection of lo-fi folk-rock tunes that find the couple navigating life in weird times.</p><div class='wide-media media'><div class='overflow-hidden aspect-ratio aspect-ratio--16x9'><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHsjnv1iDq4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=jose_contreras class="maxread center"><a href="https://headlessowlrecords.bandcamp.com/album/at-the-slaughterhouse" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>José Contreras</a></h3><p class='maxread center mt0' data-controller=share><small>Toronto, Ontario<br/> Listen to <em>At The Slaughterhouse</em> at <a href="https://headlessowlrecords.bandcamp.com/album/at-the-slaughterhouse" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> - IG: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bydivineright/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>@bydivineright</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p class='maxread center'><a href="https://bydivineright.bandcamp.com" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>By Divine Right</a> are survivors.

McLaughlin&#39;s <a href="https://weirdlines.bandcamp.com" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Weird Lines</a> project returns just in time for Sappy&#39;s resurrection. The enigmatic art-rock supergroup recently issued their second self-titled full-length, a 10-song set landing nearly six years after the first. McLaughlin remains the band&#39;s only constant, although several former members of the group appear on stage at this year&#39;s festival. The first edition of Weird Lines emerged as an interplay between C.L. and <a href="https://jonmckiel.bandcamp.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Jon Mckiel</a>, an offshoot of the former&#39;s Sackville-based band <a href="https://thenationalshield.bandcamp.com" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>The National Shield</a>. The first Weird Lines record featured McLaughlin and Mckeil, with <a href="https://juliedoiron.bandcamp.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Julie Doiron</a>, saxophonist Chris Meaney, and drummer James Anderson.

With the world locking down, touring was impossible, leaving these artifacts to live and die on the internet, supported by awkward live streams, mail-order, and little much else.

Perhaps it&#39;s fitting, given the record&#39;s roots in a moment lost in time.</p><p class='maxread center'>The album makes ample use of found audio: sounds recovered from tapes bundled with a second-hand reel-to-reel recorder Mckeil purchased from a faceless online seller. Mckeil and <a href="https://joyfultalk.bandcamp.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>JOYFULTALK</a>&#39;s Jay Crocker incorporated those artifacts into swirling fits of psychedelia. The results live in a chopped analog dreamscape, unlike anything you may have heard. Songs eerily stop and start. Tension hangs between moments of quiet beauty and oft-uncanny spates of discordance.

The organ-backed &quot;Canard&quot; feels decidedly gentler before drifting away into a mysterious cloud of atmospherics. She also appears on <em>The Frency of our Dreams</em>, a collaborative project rebuilding songs from <a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a>&#39;s <em>Volcano Volcano</em>.

The project links two Ontario-based Anishnaabe songwriters - uniting them at a fascinating juncture as they reach new heights in their respective solo ventures. On the one hand, we have Daniel Monkman, who from Hamilton launched the &quot;moccasin-gaze&quot; project <a href="http://www.zoongideewin.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Zoon</a>. At times, that act&#39;s Polaris shortlisted <em>Bleached Wavves</em> LP feels like it&#39;s in direct conversation with shoegaze giants like My Bloody Valentine. Adam Sturgeon performed at Sappys-past with his sludge/grunge/folk chimera <a href="https://thenoisymountain.bandcamp.com" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>WHOOP-Szo</a>, recently rebranding the project <a href="https://statusnonstatus.bandcamp.com" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Status/Non-Status</a> after a period of self-discovery and re-engagement with his family history.

What&#39;s incredible is how little of each artist&#39;s solo work bleeds through on the record. OMBIIGIZI shuffles through genres ranging from dream pop to latter-day emo and 90s-flavoured alternative rock. It&#39;s an album that feels surprisingly vulnerable and refreshingly outside the immediate comfort zone of either artist. It&#39;s also clearly resonating - as the critics recently voted the album onto the shortlist for this year&#39;s Polaris Prize, to be determined in September.</p><div class='wide-media media'><div class='overflow-hidden aspect-ratio aspect-ratio--16x9'><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iTP8BdSZKNA" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=wolf_castle class="maxread center"><a href="https://wolfcastle.ca/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Wolf Castle</a></h3><p class='maxread center mt0' data-controller=share><small>Pabineau First Nation, New Brunswick<br/> Listen to <em>Da Vinci&#39;s Inquest</em> at <a href="https://realwolfcastle.bandcamp.com/album/da-vincis-inquest" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> - IG: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/realwolfcastle" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>@realwolfcastle</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p class='maxread center'>At just 24, New Brunswick rapper <a href="https://wolfcastle.ca/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Wolf Castle</a>&#39;s already amassed a sizable back catalogue.

A show backed by the live instrumentation of the Toronto-based B-Sides promises to bring a whole new energy.</p><p class='maxread center'>From behind the drum kit, bandleader Donny Milwalkee guides The Dirty-B Sides, a full live band complete with horns, strings, and an improvisational bent.

That&#39;s not just good timing, as in many ways, the band feels emblematic of the artists this scene sprung from. With an instrumental bed of lo-fi fuzz (&quot;swampy,&quot; if that&#39;s not too on-the-nose) paired with Weinwurm&#39;s vulnerable, folky vocals - the 10-song album lovingly follows trail cut by Eric&#39;s Trip and Julie Doiron without ever feeling like a facsimile.</p><p class='maxread center'>The group recorded with Dave Trenaman at The Quarantine in Port Greville, Nova Scotia between the summer of 2019 and December of 2020, working in fits and starts amidst lockdowns and pandemic uncertainty. The record features the band&#39;s namesake Klarka Weinwurm on guitar, keys, and vocals, backed by bassist Ian MacDougall (<a href="https://thetomfunorchestra.bandcamp.com" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>The Tom Fun Orchestra</a>) and drummer Luke Patterson (<a href="https://themouthbreathers.bandcamp.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>The Mouthbreathers</a>), with select appearances on guitar by Zac Hackett (Lester Slade). Live the group&#39;s playing as a three-piece with Weinwurm backed by bassist Evan Matthews (The Mouthbreathers, <a href="https://yellow-teeth.bandcamp.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Yellowteeth</a>) and returning drummer Glenn Barrington (<a href="https://snakenoise1.bandcamp.com" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Snake Noise</a>).</p><p class='maxread center'>With the pandemic forcing the festival online for two years, most of us who travel from afar haven&#39;t set foot in Sackville for some time. I asked Weinwurm to give us a local perspective on how the town&#39;s weathered the storm. Here&#39;s her report:</p><blockquote class="maxquote center pl4 black-60 bl bw2 b--red"><p class='maxread center'>&quot;Like most places, Sackville has taken some hits since March 2020. Perhaps you&#39;ll notice a little gap in its smile? In a small town, it&#39;s your friends and neighbours that had to close down their business, take a pause or suffer financial loss. No time to say goodbye to some of the significant places and things that held this town together. Losing Thunder and Lightning (Our hub, pub, music venue, weirdo hang-out) was by far the biggest hit for myself and for a chunk of people in this town. I don&#39;t doubt this year&#39;s Sappy goers will feel that loss too. I worked there for 3+ years and never imagined it could just suddenly end like that. We&#39;ve struggled to find a consistent music venue or &quot;vibe&quot; ever since.</p><p class='maxread center'>So what&#39;s left standing? &#39;The Cube&#39; is still ominously guarding our marsh landscape and glows with the moon most nights. The parks still have their trees, the streets kept their names and the breeze still blows heavy. You&#39;ll come across a few closed forever signs, discover a couple cool new spots and recognize some long-standing shops, cafes and restaurants. We&#39;ve actually managed to hold onto a lot, or slowly build it over time. Sappyfest 17 will for sure be a big part of bringing more life back to this town. We deserve this weekend!&quot;</p></blockquote><div class='wide-media media'><div class='overflow-hidden aspect-ratio aspect-ratio--16x9'><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFvTL64667A" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=tough_age class="maxread center"><a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Tough Age</a></h3><p class='maxread center mt0' data-controller=share><small>Vancouver, BC<br/>Listen to <em>Which Way Am I?</em> at <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/album/which-way-am-i" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> - IG: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/toughageband/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>@toughageband</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p class='maxread center'>Of all the artists I&#39;ve profiled in this mailing, I&#39;m writing <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Tough Age</a> last. Not to be, um, sappy, but I think they may be my favourite active band. I&#39;ll remain cooly detached and weaken that by saying &quot;among my favourite active bands.&quot; This shouldn&#39;t be news to any regular Some Party reader.</p><p class='maxread center'>Following a significant change in scenery, the group returns to Sappy with a fresh lineup. While the group&#39;s most recent brush with the festival had them return to Toronto, they&#39;ve since uprooted for their original home of Vancouver. That relocation comes with a personnel shakeup - bassist/vocalist Penny Clark has stepped back from the live music grind, with original bassist Lauren Smith returning to the fold. Drummer Jesse Locke, who anchored the group&#39;s Toronto era, pulled up stakes and moved west with the group. Guitarist/vocalist Jarrett Evan Samson remains the band&#39;s creative core, making this new version of Tough Age a synthesis. If I called them the ultimate Tough Age, it wouldn&#39;t even be a misuse of the word. Perhaps you could call them the final Tough Age. In an interview earlier this year, Samson revealed as much to Some Party:</p><blockquote class="maxquote center pl4 black-60 bl bw2 b--red"><p class='maxread center'>&quot;I think the evolution of how I have seen this band is that it&#39;s a group effort. For me, combining the Toronto and Vancouver lineups in this version means this is the last Tough Age, and how long it lasts is up to the three of us to decide together. I like the group efforts of music and so the last gasp of me putting that together is realizing it&#39;s not a group if I unilaterally make decisions for everyone such as &quot;we&#39;re done.&quot;</p></blockquote><p class='maxread center'>The group emerged with their surfy garage rock debut in 2013, the same year in which <a href="https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Apollo Ghosts</a>, for whom Samson played bass, called it a day. Across their four <a href="https://www.mintrecs.com/" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Mint Records</a> releases, including 2015&#39;s <em>I Get The Feeling Central</em>, 2017&#39;s <em>Shame</em>, and 2020 <em>Which Way Am I?</em>, the band ventured further from easily quantifiable punk. Songs often spin off into extended guitar jams, becoming more boldly cerebral with each release. There&#39;s reverence here for the Flying Nun and Ork Records roster, with notes of The Clean, The Feelies, and Television if you&#39;re looking for them. Samson&#39;s famously self-deprecating, but that comes coupled with self-reflection. In our conversation, he mulled over the group&#39;s evolution, unsaid influences, and future. Here&#39;s a sizable excerpt I couldn&#39;t just keep for myself:</p><blockquote class="maxquote center pl4 black-60 bl bw2 b--red"><p class='maxread center'>&quot;I just think a band has to change, and a band is also going to change based on who is in the band. When Tough Age started, I was coming out of making surf music, and I still listen to surf music! So that bled into the beginning of Tough Age, but I&#39;m always writing songs in a million different genres, I just think how I present them has changed. And yeah, the people playing the music will always influence how it flows. A really neat example of that is &quot;Self-Confidence,&quot; which we were playing live on the <em>I Get The Feeling Central</em> tour [2015] and was like a huge Oh Sees-ish song. The song is the exact same structure on [2020&#39;s] <em>Which Way Am I?</em> but it&#39;s worlds apart from that, just because of a shift of approach.</p><p class='maxread center'>My biggest influences on what I&#39;m making are usually far outside of bands that sound similar to what we&#39;re making, but you can&#39;t drop that. No one will get it. I was talking the other day about how I play my guitar as hard as I can at almost all times, which is directly influenced by the Japanese folk artist Tomokawa Kazuki and the way he plays guitar. I can hear me trying to play like him on the self-titled, for example, but it doesn&#39;t sound anything like him.</p><p class='maxread center'>The other evolution, and maybe why [our songs] feel more thoughtful, is because my songs do often exist in a same universe, or reference each other. Thoughts building on older ones in other songs. There are story songs that are sequels to other ones (&quot;Castigation&quot; and &quot;Possession&quot; are related, say), ones where I am answering myself... I think about my dumb songs a lot.</p><p class='maxread center'>What&#39;s next? I don&#39;t know which is exciting! There&#39;s definitely some that follow what has been laid out over the last few records. I want to avoid the &quot;aging as slowing down&quot; trap. My mind is always flitting between genres and obsessions, and it will leak out (more flute coming for sure), but I don&#39;t know!</p><p class='maxread center'>One of the really nice things about having Lauren back is regaining enthusiasm for older material or seeing how it fits with me now. I think that&#39;s one of the very few advantages with having been a band for so long. It&#39;s been really interesting to reconnect with some of these songs and see how they slot into my life and art in 2022 vs when they were written. Music always seems to be the art form where treating it like art is something to be ridiculed, especially if you aren&#39;t making ambient albums or something. There are very narrow definitions of what style of music is seen as worthy art, but I treat my music that way, and it&#39;s important to me to keep changing.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class='center tc media'><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=826078594/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/album/pizza-punks">Pizza Punks by Tough Age</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><hr class='bg-black-30 mt4 mb4 maxread bn hr-1'/><p class='maxread center'>I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of space unpacking the interconnected Sappy regulars, wrapped in a comforting blanket of familiarity. However, every year the festival lines up a handful of breathtaking, singular experiences which transcend the event&#39;s roots in Canadian indie rock - a bit of perspective that art and beauty comes from all corners. In 2018 that lesson came when the operatic Jeremy Dutcher floored the packed Brunton Auditorium at Mount Allison University, delivering an arresting performance that foreshadowed his Polaris triumph a month later. This year two performers look poised to take us on unexpected journeys, and both are notable for crossing the US border for the event (a relative rarity for Sappy).</p><h3 id=circuit_des_yeux class="maxread center"><a href="https://www.kimberlyedgar.com" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Circuit des Yeux</a></h3><p class='maxread center mt0' data-controller=share><small>Chicago, Illinois<br/> Listen to <em>-io</em> at <a href="https://circuitdesyeux.bandcamp.com/album/io" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> - IG: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/circuitdesyeux" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>@circuitdesyeux</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p class='maxread center'>Based in Chicago, singer-songwriter Haley Fohr&#39;s performed as <a href="https://www.kimberlyedgar.com" class="black no-underline fw4 bb b--black" target=_blank>Circuit des Yeux</a> for 15 years, delivering a sound unlike any you&#39;ll hear on the Sappy stage.

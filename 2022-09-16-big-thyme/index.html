Less so these days. With the band continuing to delve into 70s-tinged, hard rock maximalism, there&#39;s simply less room for honk, let alone tonk. Sam hasn&#39;t forgotten his roots, though, and under the new solo guise of <a href="https://bigthyme.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Big Thyme</a> he&#39;s proudly reclaimed his Stetson. The first single from the project shares its stage name, presenting a throwback shuffle with an authentic twang. You&#39;d never guess it&#39;s a product of southern Ontario in 2022.</p><p>Visually Sam&#39;s having (perhaps) too much fun, and his homemade video plants his tongue decisively in cheek. Here we find the artist dispassionately lip-syncing while working through a cowboy hustle as if forced. Behind the line dance, lava lamps swirl on a low-budget green screen. Occasionally the camera moves in for an uncomfortable close-up, with stock footage of car races arising from the contextless ether. There&#39;s an homage to James Bond, for some reason. Sam isn&#39;t taking the piss from a sonic standpoint (see his lovingly sincere rendition of the Appalachian traditional &quot;Worried Mary&quot;), but I&#39;d love to witness the reaction to this video from some unprepared traditionalist. As a contrarian, I find the algorithmic confusion sewn by Big Thyme&#39;s visual approach deliciously nihilistic. Heck, the project&#39;s very logo even eschews its titular herb for a large pot leaf. Total anarchy, and I&#39;m here for it.</p><p>The single features Sam backed by drummer Erik Grice, with Morgan Husty layering some pedal steel over Sam&#39;s guitar, bass and piano. Backing vocals in the hooky chorus come courtesy of Toronto glam-pop hero <a href="https://nyssa.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Nyssa</a>, Sam&#39;s mother Audrey Coffey, and his fiancée Regan Macdonald. Sam commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song wouldn&#39;t have come out sounding the way it did without the amazing talent lent by my friends and family. It was just a demo before Erik Grice recorded a drum track for it. It was barely country before Morgan Hasty recorded Pedal Steel. Nyssa led the charge on the background vocals so well that it gave me room to get my family involved. I can&#39;t help but smile every time I hear my fiancée and my mom singing together on this.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>I had the pleasure of taking in Big Thyme&#39;s humble inaugural show earlier in the summer, and I&#39;m certainly on board for more. Your next chance is at his first hometown gig, slated for September 21 at Toronto&#39;s Bar Mordecai. The Iron Lungs, meanwhile, remain on guard to support their excellent third LP <em>Real One</em>, released in 2021 through <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aOQ9xf06NEg" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=dead_friends><span class=artist-title><a href="http://deadfriendss.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Dead Friends</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Ain&#39;t Now, Never Was</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://deadfriendss.bandcamp.com/album/aint-now-never-was" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Edmonton garage rock act <a href="http://deadfriendss.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Dead Friends</a> have a new 10-song full-length available today. <em>Ain&#39;t Now, Never Was</em> impressively hops between genres, trading off between surf and alt-country elements while maintaining an almost sinister atmosphere throughout. Fans of The Sadies&#39; vintage sounds or the aggressive dynamism of the Deadly Snakes should dig this.</p><p>The band hasn&#39;t issued much in the way of a public statement on this one, so I&#39;m short on details for this write-up. Don&#39;t read that as a lack of an endorsement on my part - I suspect I&#39;ll spend a lot of time with this album in the coming months.

The album&#39;s the fifth from the veteran band and their first since 2015&#39;s <em>Pacific Milk</em>. It also lands just north of the 25th anniversary of the Vancouver group&#39;s self-titled debut.</p><p>Guitarist/vocalist Ryan Dahle self-produced the new work. For years he&#39;s collecting song parts in various genres from his East Vancouver studio, the recRoom. After wrapping up an early 2020 tour with California&#39;s Donny McCaslin (notable as the bandleader on David Bowie&#39;s <em>Blackstar</em> record), Dahle and partner/bandmate Megan Bradfield relocated to a Southern Gulf Island cottage to assemble the songs. Dahle revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Moving away from my busy Vancouver studio life and from touring gave me perspective. Living in the middle of this spectacular forest on an island has put Megan and I back in touch with nature. The combination of all these things gave me laser focus to write new material and finish the songs we&#39;d started.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>McCaslin appears on saxophone on several of <em>Little Payne</em>&#39;s songs, reciprocating Dahle&#39;s contributions to his 2018 album, <em>Blow</em>.</p><p>You can hear the album&#39;s hooky lead single, &quot;Haystack Rock,&quot; now. The accompanying video, directed by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/minty.productions/" class="" target=_blank>Minty Productions</a>, features Dahle and Bradfield playing in a hundred-year-old barn, intercut with Shane Morgan-shot footage of drummer Eric J. Breitenbach playing in his neighbourhood alley in East Vancouver.</p><p>Dahle reveals:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The farm belongs to our friends and once a year they ring me up and ask me to lend a hand with hay baling in the spring, so I&#39;ve spent a lot of time lifting hay off the fields, riding their trailer into the barn and stacking bales. The song was written a couple of years before I started to help with baling, and it&#39;s always repeating in my head when I work. Because of this, the song floated to the top of the list of songs to include on our new record.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Limblifter&#39;s headed east soon for (at least) a pair of dates supporting the release. Look for them on November 3 at The Marquee in Halifax, followed by an appearance at Toronto&#39;s legendary Horseshoe Tavern on November 5.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EdKeJG7Yc9w" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=fake_palms><span class=artist-title><a href="https://www.instagram.com/fakepalmsband/" class="" target=_blank>Fake Palms</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Flags&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/iH8G9LjWf9Q" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://handdrawndracula.bandcamp.com/album/lemons" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>The new <a href="https://fakepalms-pleasence.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fake Palms</a> LP is out today, returning Michael le Riche&#39;s angular garage outlet to the turntables of the nation after a five-year absense. The record landed alongside a final pre-release video featuring the song &quot;Flags.&quot; On the track, le Riche commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Flags&#39; is a song about having to find where you fit within the machinery. Is it comfortable? Is it against what your beliefs are? Do you want to do it or do you have to do it? Do you feel like a traitor? Or are you scared at how much you actually enjoy it? We all seem to have these spectres we answer to, these things we rally for or against subconsciously. This is kind of about what happens when you are forced to stare your decisions in the face.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The clip again finds Fake Palms paired with director Justis Krar of <a href="https://www.immvproductions.com/" class="" target=_blank>IMMV Productions</a>.</p><p><em>Lemons</em>, out now on <a href="https://www.handdrawndracula.com" class="" target=_blank>Hand Drawn Dracula</a>, represents a back-to-basics approach from Le Riche. He&#39;s primarily working solo here, performing the brunt of guitar, bass, and vocals on the recordings with <a href="https://dillydally.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dilly Dally</a>&#39;s Benjamin Reinhartz on percussion. Evan Lewis of <a href="https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ducks Ltd.</a> later fleshed out a half-dozen of the songs on guitar (&quot;Flags,&quot; included), with additional appearances logged from early Palms guitarist Patrick Marshall, percussionist Braeden Craig, and <a href="https://www.twistofficial.com/" class="" target=_blank>Twist</a> vocalist Laura Hermiston. The crew recorded at Candle Recording with Josh Korody (Breeze, Beliefs) co-producing and engineering.</p><p>The new set arrives on the heels of the full-length debut from <a href="http://saunaaa.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Sauna</a>, le Riche&#39;s synth-pop trio with ex-<a href="https://www.weavesband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Weaves</a> bassist Zach Bines and <a href="https://greys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Greys</a> drummer Braeden Craig.

The group recently shared the grungy &quot;Blacklight&quot; as the first single from the forthcoming <em>Found in Floods</em> LP. Frontman Dave Mueller commented on the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I read an article about the concept of &#39;Death By Despair&#39; dealing with the never ending tragedy of suicide and how adult males in the western world are particularly susceptible and statistically more likely to die by suicide. It left an impression on me. There is this strange darkness that can sometimes lurk around adult males in North America. Expectations around social and economic achievements can create a heavy weight that can be too much for some to bear. The lack of acceptance around talking about these things is a huge issue. The idea that we all have something following us around - something that triggers us into a mentally dark place - but is rarely talked about - is something that I think you start to realize as you get older. I would say this song is a journey around that entire theme.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song finds Huron Lines again working with <a href="https://psychicvoid.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Psychic Void</a>&#39;s Josh Kaiser as producer. Jacob Rye (The Glorious Sons, Michigander) mixed, and Bill Skibbe (Fucked Up, Jack White, The Kills) mastered at Third Man in Detroit. Look for the album in early 2023. Huron Lines features guitarist/vocalist David Mueller (Full White Drag), guitarist Grainger Harris (The Movement, Silent Movie Type), bassist/vocalist RJ Brando (Silent Movie Type, Grough), and drummer Nick Mitchell (NC17, Ayndrone) - all also past members of <a href="https://clubthunderbolt.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Club Thunderbolt</a>. The band&#39;s first album, <em>Lost at the Border</em>, surfaced in November 2021.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3146968568/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://huronlines.bandcamp.com/track/blacklight">Blacklight by Huron Lines</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=julianna_riolino><span class=artist-title><a href="https://juliannariolinosings.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Julianna Riolino</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Queen of Spades&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://juliannariolinosings.bandcamp.com/track/queen-of-spades" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Could this be the most country edition of Some Party to date?</p><p>This week singer-songwriter <a href="https://juliannariolinosings.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Julianna Riolino</a> shared another glimpse into her forthcoming record <em>All Blue</em>. &quot;Queen of Spades&quot; lands as the album&#39;s third preview, again finding the artist channelling Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris, with her assertive vocals playing off Aaron Goldstein&#39;s signature pedal steel guitar.

He comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;LIQUID T est mon homage ( ou une tentative ) de faire une toune métal pour avoué au grand jour mon amour pour Metallica, Dimmu Borgir, Mastodon et Aggretsuko quand elle est en criss contre son boss et va au karaoke.

In a press release, the group revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The song alludes to the fight, flight, or freeze stress response and that serving up anger can be warranted (especially when it&#39;s towards a toxic manipulator who is the subject of this track).

You can see it set against a collage of live footage and behind-the-scenes antics in a new video directed by the band.</p><p>The group recorded with Samuel Gemme engineering at Gamma Recording Studio (Corridor, Anemone). La Sécurité features Éliane Viens-Synnott on lead vocals and synth, Félix Bélisle on bass, Kenny Smith on drums, Laurence-Anne on guitar and synth, and Melissa Di Menna on the same. The group features current and former members of Choses Sauvages, Laurence-Anne, Jesuslesfilles, Silver Dapple, DATES, and Pressure Pin. Bélisle and Gemme co-produced the set.</p><p>On the record, guitarist Melissa Di Menna shared:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#39;s an album with a lot of drive, which makes you want to move! Some of it is in French, some of it is in English, but it&#39;s not just fun and games... it also bites. It&#39;s catchy earworms delivered with a punk attitude. There&#39;s somewhat of a Twin Peak-esque, honey-dripping break midway, adding a bit of breathing room before we indulge in more contagious grooves, upping the bpm until the very end.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Look for <em>Stay Safe!</em> on June 16 through Mothland.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7igwMMmMhm4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=the_dirty_nil><span class=artist-title><a href="https://thedirtynil.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Dirty Nil</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Nicer Guy&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/LN_rmJJhbvU" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://thedirtynil.bandcamp.com/album/free-rein-to-passions" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Dundas power-trio <a href="https://thedirtynil.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Dirty Nil</a> recently announced their next album. The 10-song <em>Free Rein to Passions</em> lands May 26 through <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a>, as previewed in the bombastic lead single &quot;Nicer Guy.&quot; In a press release, guitarist/vocalist Luke Bentham promised a thrashier, less-restrained outing than the band&#39;s 2021 album:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>Fuck Art</em> had a lot of singing on it. There were not a lot of parts where you could just jam out on riffs. <em>Free Rein to Passions</em> is a bit of a nastier record where we didn&#39;t sweat the small insignificant details. If it sounded cool, we went with it.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Regarding the single, he reveals:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I&#39;d been sitting on some of the guitar parts for a long time, husbanding them for a suitably righteous song. In the depths of lockdown, I dusted them off and came up with the words. It was a happy day in an otherwise lonely time. Special shoutout to Kyle [Fisher]&#39;s extremely tight playing and Sam&#39;s stampeding elephant bass. Sincerity can feel uncomfortable, but this one feels right.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This album&#39;s the band&#39;s first with new bassist Sam Tomlinson (also of <a href="https://captainwildchild.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Captain Wildchild</a>). He linked up with the group last year, lending his high-energy stage presence to the Nil&#39;s already outsized live performances and appearing on the one-off fall single, <em>Bye Bye Big Bear</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LN_rmJJhbvU" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=mother_tongues><span class=artist-title><a href="https://mothertongues.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Mother Tongues</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;A Heart Beating&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/F4_G0XGigT0" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://mothertongues.bandcamp.com/track/a-heart-beating" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto psych group <a href="https://mothertongues.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Mother Tongues</a> recently shared the first single from their upcoming full-length.

It&#39;s a little William Gibson, a little cyberpunk, it&#39;s lit like a Wong-Kar-Wai film. It&#39;s queer, it&#39;s free, a little goth, everyone&#39;s wearing eyeliner.

The track&#39;s showcased in a new video crafted by <a href="https://aitso.org/" class="" target=_blank>Brad Aitso</a>. While sharing the visuals, Kozak reflected on the personal tragedy underlying the new work:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The death of my boyfriend in 2012 was such a profound experience - he died when we were totally in love on a joyful day and the way that he died while I was with him scarred me in an indescribable way, like a deep psychic torture for years after and on to today. To be in that level of pain, to be pushed to the edge of what you can consciously comprehend and then go past it... I think I learned the meaning of life. I think I saw beyond conscious reality and into other dimensions. Sometimes I could look at my hands and know I was here but still know I was everywhere else at the same time.</p><p>That&#39;s the essence of what I&#39;ve made this album about - the unbearable weight of profound understanding of that which cannot be described, and the feeble attempt to reconcile with living here in the normal world with the rest of you. Which is why this video is perfect. I collected some moments from my recent life and [director Brad Aitso] twisted them into a fever dream, the way the world looks from the other side.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In addition to Kozak&#39;s solo performance, the track features additional guitar and synth from <a href="http://preoccupationsband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Preoccupations</a>&#39; Scott Munro, drums from Bryan Thomas, and Grant Zubritsky on saxophone. Kozak self-produced, engineered, mixed, and mastered &quot;Beloved&quot; at Studio Saint Zo.</p><p>Kozak&#39;s logged countless hours as a live sound engineer over the past two decades, providing front-of-house engineering services for Canadian post-punk bands like Operators, Wolf Parade, and Preoccupations while also working with artists like The Strokes&#39; Albert Hammond Jr. Since her 2017 LP <em>Milking a Dead Cow</em> and a self-titled EP in 2019, the artist&#39;s issued several collections of Patreon-funded songs in various formats.

Dowd issued a statement on both the multi-faceted audio and the accompanying visuals:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In the past nothing could be recorded so most things were forgotten. Now everything can be recorded and it&#39;s usually nothing we want to remember. Television Funeral can be seen as an entire albums worth of ideas presented into one recording, one catchy enough that you hopefully will want to remember but also one caustic enough that makes it hard to forget.</p><p>The video is a jittery mess of colours and destruction.

Did The Flatliners unknowingly set Ron on his path of self-destruction and his eventual downfall? Only time will tell for sure. But yes. The answer is absolutely yes. It was all our fault.

When I started to play with it more, I immediately thought of Daniel and Adam. I love it when friendship is palpable in a recording, when a piece of music laughs with you in a fast-food burger booth and takes you out to catch up on a walk by the river. Ombiigizi strikes me as a testament to that kind of friendship, and I&#39;m in awe of the sound they make together. We had a blast making this song, and I&#39;m glad it can go out and meet some new friends in the world now.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The group recorded at The Tragically Hip&#39;s Bathouse Recording Studio with Nyles Spencer.

In a press release, vocalist Torin Craig revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It was winter during a lockdown, and I was living in a pretty bleak apartment, quite literally waiting for the sun to come back in the spring. The song is about yearning for the end of depression and despair, and trying to hold the memories of better feelings to remind yourself that no matter how bad something is, it will end, or at least change.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track, recorded with Josh Korody at Candle Recording, features Craig on vocals and 12-string guitar, Eliot Rossi on guitar, backing vocals, and percussion, Will Macquarrie on bass and backing vocals, Brian Heyes on keys, and Morgan Zych drumming.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GaVyOLILauY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=chris_page><span class=artist-title><a href="https://chrispage.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chris Page</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Alone With Your Radio</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://chrispage.bandcamp.com/album/alone-with-your-radio-ep" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Ottawa singer-songwriter <a href="https://chrispage.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chris Page</a> recently rolled out another digital single, presented (as we&#39;ve come to expect) in both high-energy &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and rootsy &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; variants.

Speaking to <a href="https://floodmagazine.com/130373/tunic-disease-/" class="" target=_blank>Flood Magazine</a>, guitarist/vocalist David Schellenberg revealed the pernicious effect of economic stability on an artform defined by struggle:</p><p>&quot;During the pandemic I found myself making a stable income and, since there was no touring, I wasn&#39;t burning it on the road pursuing what I really wanted to do, this band. I started to feel myself drift away from the identity I strived so hard to create. My entire self-worth was tied so strongly to being a touring musician, and if I didn&#39;t have that anymore, then who was I? The short answer is, just another cog in the machine, working 40+ hour weeks. The metaphor is simple. It was cancerous, it overtook my body, my life and sense of self.&quot;</p><p><em>Wrong Dream</em> lands April 28 through <a href="http://artoffact.com/" class="" target=_blank>Artoffact Records</a>, following up on Tunic&#39;s 2021 LP <em>Quitter</em>.

The label&#39;s assembled a 26-track LP from the band&#39;s scattered material, including the songs from their rare 1980 double LP. That album, recorded in the fall of 1978 and 1979, is believed to be limited to 200 copies in its original run. Da Slyme issued that album with randomly selected thrift store LP jackets, with their name stencilled and spray painted overtop. While Celluloid Lunch&#39;s revamp assembles new art from the band&#39;s archives, the label paid tribute to its scuzzy roots with a new slate of 50 thrifted covers. Those are, as you may expect, now sold out.</p><p>The band&#39;s Kirt Sic-o-via reflected on the release at Bandcamp:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The greatest punk rock album never made - by a band that played on stage with a toilet (inside joke). At this time (2023), it&#39;s been 24 years since the last foray of Da Slyme. 45 years since it&#39;s first. Time is a great leveller. It separates the feelings you had about a project at the early incarnation from an accurate assessment of its value and place. Age is a great leveller too. It turns a &#39;who cares&#39; attitude into a &#39;yeah it was better than it felt&#39; and back into a &#39;who the fuck cares and let&#39;s do it anyway&#39; attitude. So myself (Kirt Sic-o-via) and Stig Stilletto and No Moniker embarked on a journey through recordings of the shows and various rehearsal tapes (we only ever played around 30 shows). It was a proverbial gas, A trip down the &#39;bad craziness&#39; of memory lane. Jesus were we that bad (?) but look at all these other things that were great - I didn&#39;t ever remember that we played that good (note: it is punk and everything is relative) but it is definitely rock, and often abrasive rock to boot. Tuning is erratic and maybe even irrelevant (we didn&#39;t have guitar tuners until &#39;82).</p><p>The recording sources are varied, as one can also hear on our 1980 vinyl, if you are lucky enough to have or find one - only couple of crossovers here. Note: to find the double 1980 release you have to be lucky or rich, neither or both. There&#39;s also a CD from &#39;99. Same provisos apply. Recordings are from board tapes, recordings with a couple of mics in the ceiling, cassettes, reel-to-reel stereo or 4-track, and video sources. All are from live shows or rehearsals, plus a couple of radio ads. So, the quality varies. That&#39;s punk too (not the homogenized mainstream studio/some producer variety). It&#39;s been a slice, talk to you again in 20 years...t o be listened to in the spirits from which it was made.</p><p>Old Slyme motto: &#39;If there&#39;s no rubble, you haven&#39;t played&#39;. This is the rubble of the years.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>If There&#39;s No Rubble, You Haven&#39;t Played</em> arrives June 1.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=150862007/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://celluloidlunch.bandcamp.com/album/da-slyme-if-theres-no-rubble-you-havent-played-collected-recordings-1977-89">Da Slyme: "If There's No Rubble, You Haven't Played": Collected Recordings 1977-89 by Da Slyme</a></iframe> </body></html> </div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2023-05-03-fixed-up-by-orange-light/" rel=next title="Next article: Fixed Up By Orange Light"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Fixed Up By Orange Light</div> <div class=pagination-date>May 3, 2023</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2023-04-05-i-make-the-same-mistakes/" rel=prev title="Previous article: I Make the Same Mistakes"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>I Make the Same Mistakes</div> <div class=pagination-date>April 5, 2023</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

You can hear it now at Bandcamp or see it visualized in a rather enigmatic new video on YouTube.</p><p>Ogden&#39;s spent years playing around the East Coast in several styles. He&#39;s perhaps best known for the folk-rock outfit <a href="https://pennyblacks.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Penny Blacks</a> (their last record, 2017&#39;s <em>Long Lights</em>, garnered several nominations at the Prix MNB Awards). The road to this new expression found him serving stints with lo-fi rockers <a href="http://papalvisit.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Papal Visit</a> and making noise with the punk group <a href="https://hospitalgrade.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Hospital Grade</a> (itself an evolution of the 90s-era <a href="https://notfunnyanymore.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>NotFunnyAnymore</a>).</p><p>This track finds Ogden backed by Hospital Grade alumni Sean Boyer on drums and Brett Whitaker on guitar, with Geoff Smith (Papal Visit, Little You Little Me, Tooth &amp; The Fang) playing bass. While we don&#39;t yet have details on the forthcoming full-length, I do have word that it&#39;ll feature guest appearances from Constantine <a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a>, Jim MacAlpine of the Haligonian post-hardcore group <a href="https://northofamerica.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>North of America</a>, and Chad Peck of Halifax power-pop act <a href="https://kestrels.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Kestrels</a>.

Toronto dark-wave quartet <a href="https://gloinxo.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Gloin</a> is the latest to fall into their powerful orbit, following a similar path as their contemporaries in Hot Garbage. The Montreal label&#39;s readying the band&#39;s forthcoming long-player <em>We Found This</em> for an October 21 release. It&#39;s a 10-song set led by the scorching post-punk single &quot;Shoot to Kill.&quot; You can hear that at Bandcamp now or see it visualized in an animated video by <a href="https://www.christophermccluskey.com" class="" target=_blank>Chris McCluskey</a>. The director comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The &#39;Shoot to Kill&#39; video animation was intended to support the energetic style and sound of Gloin. Using stop frame animation techniques, the viewer is visually reminded of classic styles of the 80s &amp; 90s. The drawings in the video are representative of the idea that monotony can be to blame for madness. Overlays, distortion, visual reverb and chaotic vibe of the animation aim to encapsulate Gloin&#39;s onstage presence.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Gloin recorded with <a href="http://tallies.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Tallies</a>&#39; Dylan Frankland at Soleil Sound and Palace Recording in Toronto, with <a href="https://www.holyfuckmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Holy Fuck</a>&#39;s Graham Walsh mixing. The band features guitarist/vocalist John Watson, bassist/vocalist Vic Byers, synth player Richard Garnham, and drummer Simon Kou - with roots in the indie rock act <a href="https://heybrenda.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Brenda</a> and the metal band <a href="https://witchrot.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Witchrot</a>.</p><p>This latest material follows Gloin&#39;s 2019 EP <em>Soft Monster</em> and the accompanying <em>Live Monster</em> performances.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWYnFXTmC0s" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=prism_shores><span class=artist-title><a href="https://prismshores.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Prism Shores</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Diving Bell&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/0wzfizvXmGo" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://prismshores.bandcamp.com/album/inside-my-diving-bell" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Montreal jangle-pop act <a href="https://prismshores.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Prism Shores</a> are back with a bright new single. &quot;Diving Bell&quot; is our first glimpse into <em>Inside My Diving Bell</em>, a new collection due September 23.

Vocalist Franco Rossino commented on the track in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It seems that these days even some of our more intelligent friends find themselves trapped in loops of cyclic discourse, in an endless battle between other chronically-online walking encyclopedias fruitlessly attempting to force the truth into submission. The song &#39;Pull Me Up&#39; (a reference to &#39;Pulled Up&#39; by the Talking Heads) is all about reaching out to those friends who have been inside too long, their brains fried from a repetitive strain injury.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Dumb features guitarist/vocalist Franco Rossino backed by drummer Pipe Morelli, guitarist Nick Short, and bassist Shelby Vredik. The group self-recorded at Choms, a studio co-owned by Short and Rossino. The new record follows up on 2019&#39;s <em>Club Nites</em>, their sophomore LP for Mint. Between that record and this, they also partnered with labelmates <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a> on last year&#39;s <em>Pizza Punks</em> - a split 7&quot; issued in a celebration of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tundrawizard/" class="" target=_blank>Cole Pauls</a>&#39; comic of the same name.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cT3cDwYMngM" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=roswit><span class=artist-title><a href="https://roswit.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Roswit</a></span><span class=media-title>Demos</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://roswit.bandcamp.com/album/roswit-demos" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Speaking of <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a> ...</p><p><a href="https://roswit.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Roswit</a>&#39;s a new band quietly emerging in Vancouver from former Tough Age bassist/co-vocalist Penny Clark. A set of three phone-recorded demos available on Bandcamp find her performing in a trio with Selina Crammond from <a href="https://midnightnews.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Midnight News</a>/<a href="https://allmoonsaresuper.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Supermoon</a> and Marita from <a href="https://divorcer.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Divorcer</a>. It looks like the project&#39;s picking up some of the material Clark workshopped in her short-lived pre-pandemic Toronto project Grape.</p><p>Penny&#39;s last record with Tough Age was 2020&#39;s <em>Which Way Am I?</em>. While she&#39;s stepped away from touring life, it&#39;s nice to hear that she&#39;s not leaving her Raincoats-styled vocals on the shelf. Before relocating to Vancouver, Clark took the spotlight in <a href="http://rottencolumn.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Rotten Column</a>, a scrappy punk offshoot of Tough Age where she sang lead. They issued a pair of tapes before the world fell apart.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=706921651/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://roswit.bandcamp.com/album/roswit-demos">Roswit demos by Roswit</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=the_sorels><span class=artist-title><a href="https://thesorels1.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Sorels</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Love Your Rock &#39;N Roll&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Purchase at <a href="https://retarecords.bandcamp.com/album/love-your-rock-n-roll" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> - Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/Iih_95JtmJ0" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>This week the Winnipeg glam rock / bubblegum-punk act <a href="https://thesorels1.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Sorels</a> are issuing their third EP for <a href="https://retarecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Reta Records</a>. <em>Love Your Rock N&#39; Roll</em> features four new recordings from the trio of vocalist/bassist Jo Jo Rodriguez, guitarist Jennifer Alexander, and drummer Jill Lynott. Of those tunes, three are originals in the band&#39;s vibrantly vintage style, and one&#39;s a cover of &quot;Another School Day&quot; by the English glam band Hello. You can see the title track performed in a gleeful new video from director Gwen Trutnau.</p><p>Cam Loeppky (Figure Walking, Christine Fellows) recorded and mixed at Winnipeg&#39;s Argyle Studio.

It&#39;s compelling for that reason alone. Faiyaz Shah commented on Instagram:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Flutter was written years ago as a teenager. It deals with unrequited love and relationships going their course. But instead of the pain and anger of a fast breakup tune, flutter beckons you to accept and be grateful to what you aren&#39;t and what can&#39;t be.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track features project-lead Faiyaz Shah on guitar, bass, and vocals, backed by drummer Dylan Guiliano. Blue Hardy produced and mixed.

Archibald revealed the story behind the tune at Bandcamp:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;A short while after my friend Mike moved out of town, we were talking on the phone and I teasingly asked if he missed anyone back in the city, sorta fishing for sympathy I guess. Without skipping a beat he said:</p><p>&#39;Well, mostly I&#39;ve been thinking about the girl who used to work at Alexandra&#39;s&#39;</p><p>Right away I knew who he was talking about. Many years before, while going to college I lived next to a pizza shop in the South end. I ate there every week for my whole degree, most weeks more than once, and at least a few times, up to three times in a single day. I kept their doors open and they kept me alive. Pizza Girl was about our age and worked there at the time. She fed us hundreds of slices over the years, and eventually a casual acquaintanceship grew into a low-key crush. We never even got her name.</p><p>When Mike heard the finished song, he described it as &#39;the story of any young man looking for love in a delicious place.&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This time out, the band finds Archibald backed by bassist Neal Read, drummer Kevin MacIssac, with Jordan Murphy accompanying on a güiro. The track took a few years to come together, with vocals, rhythm guitar, and drums recorded with <a href="https://bydivineright.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>By Divine Right</a>&#39;s José Contreras in Toronto back in 2019.

It&#39;s about the death of the small town and the call to join the city mass. More than that, it is a tribute to friends and about travelling between worlds to see them along the way. It&#39;s a song about how sorely they are missed and how we can&#39;t really blame them for moving away.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band recorded this 10-song set with Matthew Wiewel at Sudbury&#39;s Deadpan Studios.

The song&#39;s part of the soundtrack of <em>The Getgoes</em>, an animated film directed by vocalist Joel Wassen for which the band provided the soundtrack. The accompanying video showcases <a href="https://hotsytotsycreative.wordpress.com/" class="" target=_blank>Peter Guindon</a>&#39;s animation from the project. The band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Thoughts and Prayers&#39; explores the narrative of gun violence in the States and the ongoing inaction of the political powers to take meaningful action. Where all too often the platitude of &#39;Thoughts and Prayers&#39; is offered from the very politicians receiving lobby money from the NRA. Although animated, the video and song pulls no punches in regard to illustrating this hypocrisy.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>The Getgoes</em> is currently on the film festival circuit, showing at events in Amsterdam, Berlin and New York, with a Toronto screening slated for December 3. <em>The Getgoes</em> soundtrack found The Discarded working with producer John Critchley at Green Door.</p><p>The Discarded features brothers Caden Jax (drums) and Jared Dean (bass) performing with their father, guitarist/vocalist J.P. Wasson. Wasson&#39;s a scene vet, having drummed for the Toronto punk act <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Column_(band)" class="" target=_blank>Fifth Column</a> in the early 90s. He also appeared on drums and vocals for punk act The Snowdogs during that era.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WfWoMp0eGag" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=tripper_and_the_wild_things><span class=artist-title><a href="https://tripperandthewildthings.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tripper and the Wild Things</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Get Burnt&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://tripperandthewildthings.bandcamp.com/track/get-burnt-single" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Hamilton rock group <a href="https://tripperandthewildthings.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tripper and the Wild Things</a> issued an energetic new single last week titled &quot;Get Burnt.&quot; It&#39;s the first preview of their new EP <em>Fever Dreams</em>, due September 30. Speaking to <a href="https://fromthestrait.com/articles/freshly-pressed-tripper-and-the-wild-things-get-burnt/" class="" target=_blank>From The Straight</a>, the band revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The entire EP&#39;s theme deals with the transitional period between adolescence and adulthood. The tune is about making those mistakes, learning from them, and reflecting on it all afterwards when you find yourself further down the road. Get Burnt aims to remind listeners of the times growing up with friends where you&#39;d try to squeeze as much as you can out of those last, dog days of summer.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The four-piece features vocalist/guitarist Josh Keillor, bassist Eric Tarquinio, guitarist James Puntillo, and drummer Brian MacMahon. The band recorded with Simon Austin (Incase We Crash), with the new set following up on their 2021 EP <em>Boomerang Kids</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1975571936/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://tripperandthewildthings.bandcamp.com/track/get-burnt-single">Get Burnt (Single) by Tripper and the Wild Things</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=still_insane><span class=artist-title><a href="https://stillinsane.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Still Insane</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Black Sheep&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch at <a href="https://youtu.be/NRxkhxeWi5E" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://thousandislandsrecords.bandcamp.com/album/black-sheep" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Last week Quebec City punks <a href="https://stillinsane.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Still Insane</a> shared a video for &quot;Black Sheep,&quot; the title track to their recent EP for <a href="https://thousandislandsrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Thousand Islands Records</a>.

The band comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In 2020 when everything shut down, Winnipeg had a small window that summer where indoor venues could put on extremely limited capacity, fully seated shows so we and our local best buds, The Ripperz, decided to throw a fundraiser show for The Park Theatre who, like so many of us, were going through a tough time.</p><p>It turned into two sold-out nights in a row so I thought, well this is going to be weird and amazing and beautiful, let&#39;s record both nights and see what we can create from it. Those two shows turned out to be the only shows we played that year.</p><p>It was a strange time for live music, but the feeling in the room those two nights is something we will never forget and we are so thrilled to have those memories pressed to spin at 33rpms.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The twelve-song set notably captures the first live performance of the band&#39;s recent single, &quot;Whiskey Water.&quot; Mobina Galore features guitarist/vocalist Jenna Priestner and drummer/vocalist Marcia Hanson. They last issued the acoustic EP <em>Waiting</em> in 2021 through <a href="http://newdamagerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>New Damage</a> and <a href="https://gunnerrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Gunner Records</a>.

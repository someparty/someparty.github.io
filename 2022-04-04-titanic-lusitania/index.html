Last week I turned 40 - and while I loathe acknowledging my birthdays at the best of times, I used the numerological heft of this one as an excuse to draw a few new lines. I may have thrown a bit of an existential tantrum in the process.</p><p>Before the big day arrived, I nixed most of the social media in my life. That&#39;s going to have an impact here, at least psychologically. I&#39;ve rejected the pressure to over-brand this venture from the start, and there&#39;s never been an official Some Party presence to upkeep elsewhere. Through personal accounts, though, I&#39;d share the link to each edition, dutifully tagging each artist I referenced in a given week. It was a reliable wellspring of cheap validation - an easy way to accrue likes, shares, and hollow digital attaboys. It accomplished very little in terms of subscriber growth - but the dopamine hits were just lovely.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t real, though - it was too wrapped up in the systems built to hold my attention by flattering my ego - so now I&#39;m going to do without.</p><p>Whatever I&#39;m seeking post-40, recognition as some quippy, always-online personality isn&#39;t it. Free from these distractions, I&#39;m hoping to engage with the world without half my mind drawn to my phone. I fully intend for that newfound clarity to reflect in what I&#39;m producing here; however, given my reduced online footprint, your direct feedback is now all the more vital. It&#39;s just me and you, faceless email recipient, and you know how to reach me.</p><h3 id=night_court><span class=artist-title><a href="https://nightcourtpunk.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Night Court</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Titanic&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch at <a href="https://youtu.be/B_MTdzfhgak" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://nightcourtpunk.bandcamp.com/album/nervous-birds-too" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>The Vancouver trio <a href="https://nightcourtpunk.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Night Court</a> has a May 6 release slated for the second volume in their two-part debut. The group emerged with <em>Nervous Birds! One</em> in December, a brisk and hooky slate of punky power-pop. The 12-song <em>Nervous Birds! Too</em> completes the group&#39;s manic brain dump of pandemic era songwriting, a set you can preview through the bright new single &quot;Titanic.&quot; Last week, the song arrived with a video premiering at my old haunt of <a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/77038/night-court-titanic" class="" target=_blank>Punknews.org</a>. There, bassist/vocalist <a href="https://jiffymarx.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jiffy Marx</a> commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This video was a real group effort because we were low on time. We shot the band stuff in my basement the day after my birthday then I left to play some solo shows in California the next day. Dave did the puppet animation while I was gone and Emily got to warm up her acting muscles which we will have her fully flexing in future vids!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Night Court features Marx (of the BC new wavers <a href="http://autogramm.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Autogramm</a>), along with guitarist Dave Soul (<a href="https://jiffymarker.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jiffy Marker</a>, <a href="https://bloodmeridiancanada.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Blood Meridian</a>), and drummer Emilor Jane (<a href="https://synchromantics.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Synchromantics</a>, <a href="https://petblessings.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Pet Blessings</a>).</p><p>Like its predecessor, <em>Nervous Birds!

The track landed alongside a video from director Colin Medley, starring Allie Higgins. In a statement, Edkins revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Lusitania&#39; was a big breakthrough for the entire Weird Nightmare album. I realized that, musically, my goal was to make songs that would make people feel good! This idea of waking up from a terrible dream or winter changing into spring. Momentary relief. We all need that feeling right now and music has always been what I turn to most.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Edkins, well-known as the guitarist/vocalist of Toronto noise-punk originators <a href="http://www.metzztem.com/" class="" target=_blank>METZ</a>, has a May 20 release date lined up via <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a>. His 10-song set, recorded during his main band&#39;s pandemic downtime, features several notable guests, including Calgary folk mutant <a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chad VanGaalen</a> and Alicia Bognanno of Nashville&#39;s <a href="http://www.bullythemusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bully</a>. A record release show, supported by Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://shamfamily.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sham Family</a>, is scheduled for May 21 at The Baby G, followed by a tour with <a href="https://kiwijr.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Kiwi Jr.</a> that crisscrosses the border.</p><p>METZ released <em>Atlas Vending</em>, their fourth proper full-length, on <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain Records</a> and <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a> in October of 2020.

It arrives September 30 through <a href="https://fortunestellarrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fortune Stellar Records</a>. The group, which has persisted in one form or another since 1989, commented that the record&#39;s first single tells &quot;a true tour story about our adventure in Nakusp BC, and beyond.&quot; You can hear &quot;St. Leon&#39;s&quot; at Bandcamp now.</p><p>The track arrived alongside a lyric video comprised cross-Canada road footage. The song features the band&#39;s modern core trio of guitarist/vocalist José Contreras, bassist/vocalist Alysha Haugen, and drummer Geordie Dyne, with Stuart Cameron (The Heartbroken, Matthew Good) contributing a guest guitar solo.</p><p>By Divine Right&#39;s prior full-length was a curious one. They issued <em>Speak &amp; Spell US</em> in 2016, a song-for-song cover of Depeche Mode&#39;s 1981 debut (with the synths swapped for guitars). <em>Organized Accidents</em> preceded in 2013. In 2020 the entire band appeared on <em>Let It Beek</em>, backing singer-songwriter <a href="https://schoonderbeekwithbdr.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Dave Schoonderbeek</a> on his recent LP. Frontman José Miguel Contreras issued the solo LP <em>At The Slaughterhouse</em> in 2019 through <a href="http://headlessowl.com/" class="" target=_blank>Headless Owl</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/144ohspO67g" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=steven_lambke><span class=artist-title><a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Sea Level&quot; / &quot;Acorns And Beach Stones&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://stevenlambke.bandcamp.com/album/sea-level-acorns-and-beach-stones" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Following a pair of songs shared last month, <a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a>&#39;s offered up another preview of his upcoming solo set <em>Volcano Volcano</em>. You can now hear &quot;Sea Level&quot; and &quot;Acorns And Beach Stones&quot; streaming at Bandcamp. The former boasts some stripped-down guitar rock reminiscent of Lambke&#39;s later Baby Eagle material, described as &quot;a party song for growing things.&quot;</p><p>The artist had more to muse on the latter. He ponders at Bandcamp:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;When the whole is incomprehensible we might try and understand it by its parts. Big things, like oceans and oak trees, remembered in some small way by the acorn or the polished stone sitting now on the window sill. Big things like &quot;the world&quot; or &quot;nature&quot;. I don&#39;t like these words when used as if to refer to something completely separate from us, something that we might interact with, look at, or experience. Something separate that we might contemplate, exploit, or even love. I was looking for a language of relationship, of connection. A language that affirmed a shared existence. A language of mutuality.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Lambke, known as a guitarist and co-vocalist of the beloved <a href="http://theconstantines.wordpress.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constantines</a>, has the new record on deck for an April 29 release via <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>. The songs feature <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a> on drums, organ, and vocals, Dave Nardi on bass, and Carson McHone on backing vocals, with material recorded both at Welland, Ontario&#39;s Camera Varda and Lambke&#39;s Toronto home.</p><p><em>Volcano Volcano</em> follows up 2019&#39;s <em>Dark Blue</em> LP and several COVID-era curios. These include the instrumental <em>dub.tape</em> EP and the lead vocal role on Romano&#39;s hardcore-styled <em>Spider Bite</em> (part of the landmark run of roughly a dozen records Danny issued in the first year of the pandemic).</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3159545319/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://stevenlambke.bandcamp.com/album/sea-level-acorns-and-beach-stones">Sea Level / Acorns And Beach Stones by Steven Lambke</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=the_fuckin_astronauts><span class=artist-title><a href="https://tfa2000.bandcamp.com/album/pj-tyle" class="" target=_blank>The Fuckin Astronauts</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Pistol John&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch at <a href="https://youtu.be/EhTpY3qCS1k" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Last week Toronto synth-punk duo <a href="https://tfa2000.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Fuckin Astronauts</a> shared a video for &quot;Pistol John.&quot; The new single continues the band&#39;s descent into scuzzy lo-fi, a quest they&#39;ve approached with an aggressive zeal that reminds me of The Spits.

The track&#39;s our first preview of the album <em>Strange Vacation</em>.</p><p>In a press release, Bull comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Mother Lover&#39; is a modern-day romance - a song about a girl who&#39;s been dating a &#39;mama&#39;s boy&#39;.

In a press release, singer/guitarist Erin Jenkins commented on the track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Like a Movie&quot; is three minutes of indie rock bliss in the artistic vein of Sharon Van Etten or Alvvays.

The piece, directed by <a href="https://www.indicity.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Indi City</a>&#39;s Alex Manitopyes and Angel Aubichon, features a cinematic exploration of Miesha Louie&#39;s childhood as a mixed-Secwépemc girl in the East Kootenay region of BC. The video also opens with a reading of the poem &quot;Mixedblood Girls&quot; by Rain Prud&#39;Homme, which Louie credits with spurring her to write the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t &#39;come out&#39; as NDN on this track, I&#39;ve always been. But I&#39;ve never used my platform as an artist to talk about my disjointed connection with my Indigenous identity. It was hard to be so vulnerable, but I was inspired, and it was something I needed to do. I heard Rain Prudhomme read her poem Mixedblood Girls one evening, when I attended my hometown friend Smokii Sumac&#39;s book launch here in Calgary. She was sharing her mixed experience so openly and it was beautiful and I related and I was drawn to it immediately.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Miesha &amp; The Spanks plays as a duo, pairing Louie with drummer Sean Hamilton.

Vocalist Evan Resnik commented on the piece, which again finds them working with director Ryan Kostel:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The song is about getting stuck in what comforts you and losing years inside passive contentment. Time passes, you realize all those plans you had for yourself have charred on the back burner or disappeared completely. You thought you were happy, but it was just the safety of your situation, a relationship or a decent job, that made you feel this way. Suddenly the world is dull and you feel like your time is up. I&#39;m very afraid of that feeling and these days I try my best to avoid it.</p><p>The video was made by Calgary-based multimedia artist Ryan Kostel. He reworked old film footage and ran it through different media (weird lenses, old TVs, VCRs, etc.) to create a visual story for the song.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Subterranea</em> landed on the <a href="https://www.mothland.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mothland</a> label, showcasing a slate of isolation songwriting from multi-instrumentalist Mathieu Blanchard and vocalist Evan Resnik.

That record, titled <em>Freehand</em>, lands on August 5. You can hear the rootsy track at Bandcamp or accompanied by some vintage-looking film from director Rob Rice. Speaking on the song, Cameron shared:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The term &#39;Fault Lines&#39; could serve as a metaphor for many elements of the fractures between things we see and feel but also the past and future, and frankly any pair of opposites. The song is two parts, the first half speaking more to my failures (shortcomings), and the second half more critiquing the world&#39;s (sometimes palpable voids).&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This track features Cameron on guitar and bass, Aiden Ayers on lap steel and violin, with Josh Contant drumming. Based in Vancouver, Colyn Cameron&#39;s following up her 2018 LP <em>Sad &amp; Easy</em>.

I suspect that one day I&#39;ll be able to track when my family&#39;s been sick by analyzing the publish dates of this newsletter like the rings on a cut tree.</p><hr/><p>With the release date nearly upon us, it was high time that <a href="http://www.drunkensailorrecords.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>Drunken Sailor Records</a> gave the world a taste of the new <a href="https://cornerboys.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Corner Boys</a> LP. That album, the Vancouver punk band&#39;s new full-length, arrives on May 3. The UK label&#39;s the home to <em>Waiting for 2020</em>, the group&#39;s first long-player after a pair of vibrant and authentic `77-styled punk singles (2017&#39;s <em>Just Don&#39;t Care</em> and last year&#39;s <em>Love Tourist</em>). You can check the new tune &quot;Norman&quot; and the title track &quot;Waiting for 2020&quot; below. In both, you&#39;ll see the untampered-with lineage of genre originators like The Undertones and Buzzcocks, but also the bones of that mythical early BC scene that spawned the Young Canadians and the Pointed Sticks.</p><p>The band recorded the album&#39;s 10 songs with Jeffrey McCloy of <a href="https://fashionism.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fashionism</a> during the 2018 Halloween weekend. Daniel Husayn at North London Bomb Factory mixed and mastered the record. Corner Boys features <a href="https://hoseheadrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hosehead Records</a> principal Patrick Bertrand, Joel Butler of <a href="https://nervoustalk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nervous Talk</a>, and Wade from <a href="https://stresseating.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stress Eating</a>. Butler and Bertrand also play these days as members of the explosive BC punk group <a href="https://chainwhip.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chain Whip</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2614660274/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://drunkensailorrecords.bandcamp.com/album/waiting-for-2020-lp">Waiting For 2020 LP by Corner Boys</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://drunkensailorrecords.bandcamp.com/album/waiting-for-2020-lp" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Corner Boys - &quot;Norman&quot; / &quot;Waiting for 2020&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>May 10 will see the debut full-length from <a href="https://quakerparents.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Quaker Parents</a>, the weirdo indie-pop solo project from Mark Grundy of the affable Halifax rock experimenters <a href="https://heavenforreal.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Heaven For Real</a>. The record&#39;s titled <em>Our Drawing Club</em> and will carry the <a href="https://vainmina.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Vain Mina Records</a> label (it&#39;ll see a May 15 release on the Japanese label Moorworks as well).</p><p>Grundy workshopped this material in several locals, writing in Montreal, on a residency in the Azores, and most recently in Toronto. The album&#39;s 11 songs were finalized in 2018, with Mark&#39;s twin brother J. Scott Grundy (Heaven For Real, JJ Purple) contributing percussion in the studio. The album was recorded and mixed by Mark with Stephen Prickett.</p><p>The lead single from the record, titled &quot;One Time Luv,&quot; arrived alongside a video by Jordan Yeye. I&#39;ll admit I wasn&#39;t quite sure at first how to process some of the samples and electronic elements looping in the background of this track, but colour me intrigued as I&#39;ve been cycling back to this all week.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdZtZcSWLUI" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/gdZtZcSWLUI" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Quaker Parents - &quot;One Time Luv&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>The <a href="https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Booji Boys</a> are set to return this summer with their third LP, and once again find themselves working with the above-mentioned <a href="http://www.drunkensailorrecords.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>Drunken Sailor Records</a> (who, come to think of it, have amassed quite an impressive and sonically diverse coast-to-coast roster of Canadian punk bands). The group&#39;s next full-length looks to be titled <em>Tube Reducer</em>. It follows up the band&#39;s 2017 Christmas release <em>Weekend Rocker</em>, their self-titled debut from earlier that year, and along with a handful of since-released EPs (<em>Sweet Boy</em> on Cruel Noise and the recent <em>Unknown Pleathers</em> 7&quot; on <a href="http://sewerciderecords.limitedrun.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sewercide</a>).</p><p>The band posted a promo tape online last week showcasing three new songs: &quot;Lucky Citizen,&quot; &quot;Life as a Fed,&quot; and &quot;New Replacement.&quot; Booji Boys&#39; MO doesn&#39;t change on these tracks: they remain thrilling and gleefully shambolic. While you can&#39;t understand most of what vocalist Alex Mitchell&#39;s singing at any given time, it strangely doesn&#39;t matter. Booji Boys is a feeling.</p><p>The band features Mitchell along with guitarists Cody Googoo and Steve Earle, bassist Adam LeDrew, and drummer Justin Crowe.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2104682732/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/album/tube-reducer-promo-tape">TUBE REDUCER PROMO TAPE by Booji Boys</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/album/tube-reducer-promo-tape" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Booji Boys - <em>Tube Reducer</em> promo tape @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>I&#39;ve had <a href="http://theshiverettes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Shiverettes</a> scribbled in my Some Party scratch notes for the better part of a month, but they waited right until the release day to share any of their caustic new record <em>Real Shrill Bitches</em>. Continuing the thread from their 2017 debut <em>Dead Men Can&#39;t Cat Call</em>, the Calgary four-piece churn out a riot grrrl-inspired punk sound that&#39;s both angry and playful, pairing feminist social commentary with sarcastic wit. You can stream the whole 10-song record now at Bandcamp.</p><p>The band features vocalist Hayley Muir, guitarist Kaely Cormack, bassist Cecilia Schlemm, and drummer Steve Richter. Shiverettes worked with producer Eddie Dalrymple (bassist for Calgary psych-pop act <a href="https://shakingboxmusic.bandcamp.com/album/holgans-are-dead" class="" target=_blank>Holgans</a>) on the record, with co-production and mixing by Pat Palardy.

The song features saxophone by Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://josephshabason.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Joseph Shabason</a>, who recorded notable contributions to records by Destroyer and The War On Drugs.</p><p>Surrender arrived from the ashes of the now-defunct heretic-punk group <a href="https://crusades666.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Crusades</a>, featuring Dave Williams and Skottie Lobotomy from that band&#39;s roster (the pair were also part of the high-fantasy metal trio <a href="https://blacktower.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Black Tower</a>). The duo tracked an LP&#39;s worth of songs in their respective home studios over the past year, with Alex Gamble (PUP, Fucked Up, Alvvays) producing and mixing the new music at The Hive in Toronto.</p><p>In the premiere at <a href="https://newnoisemagazine.com/song-premiere-interview-surrender-hurt-no-more/" class="" target=_blank>New Noise</a>, Williams commented on the track&#39;s 80s influences and Alex Gamble&#39;s outsized role in bringing them to the fore:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;A huge part of this recording experience being such a wonderful one was finding a kindred spirit in our producer/mixer Alex Gamble. As a fellow 80’s pop nerd and seemingly bottomless well of great ideas, Alex plays a huge role in Surrender’s sound, taking the melee of tracks we send his way and shaping them into something so much better than we’d envisioned. It’s Alex’s wealth of pop music knowledge and his ability to just know when and where to add those very touchstone sounds – that gated snare in this case – that really tether our songs to that sound and era, not to mention his undeniable gifts as an engineer. I really can’t overstate Alex’s contribution in terms of the overall vibe of these songs. I also think that Scott’s voice is so well-suited to deliver the kinda, I dunno, emotivity associated with our aforementioned influences. He’s got so much natural conviction and expression in his voice, which could be the main ‘something’ that separates the pop stars of the 80’s from much of the current crop...&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling=no frameborder=0 allowtransparency=true allowfullscreen=true data-src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsurrendersounds%2Fvideos%2F280851079468573%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/surrendersounds/videos/280851079468573/" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Surrender - &quot;Hurt No More&quot; @ Facebook</a></p><p>Crunchy Hamilton power-pop/garage-rock group <a href="https://schizophrenicrex.bandcamp.com/album/a-collection-of-love-songs-lp" class="" target=_blank>No Blues</a> have a new video online for the track &quot;I&#39;m Whatever,&quot; a song from their December-released <a href="https://schizophrenicrex.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Schizophrenic Records</a> LP <em>A Collection of Love Songs</em>.

Titled <em>Night Mirror</em>, the new set will arrive on June 13 from <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a>, following up 2017&#39;s <em>and the Magic of Horses</em>. Indeed the new set does feature &quot;Angel,&quot; the provocative, if not bizarrely off-brand, pop tune New Swears teased fans with a few weeks ago. It&#39;s the album&#39;s closing track, in fact. However, two new song previews should reassure fans as they find the band playing in their usual wheelhouse of mildly-sleazy, country-adjacent slacker-pop. You can find the tracks &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on your streaming service of choice now, or check out the former through a new, thoroughly NFSW video.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://exclaim.ca/music/article/new_swears_fight_off_an_alien_in_nsfw_bon_voyage_video" class="" target=_blank>Exclam</a>, the band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Typically, band videos are kinda mundane and uneventful so we thought it would be cool to have a gunfight with an alien and maybe a penis thrown in for excitement... We also wanted to make sure we had an arm chop scene, heart pull-out scene and a penis cut-off scene. We just weren&#39;t sure which order to do it... arm, heart, penis? Or penis, arm, heart? Arm, heart, penis seemed like the best fit for us.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Watching this, I&#39;m mostly concerned about why how and why there was a plugged-in sawzall just laying around in a parking lot.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gRT_qqvIf0s" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/gRT_qqvIf0s" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: New Swears - &quot;Night Mirror&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>By contrast, there&#39;s no dismemberment one way or the other in the video for <a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a>&#39;s &quot;Cut Flowers.&quot; The Colin Medley-directed clip features the stark and poetic track from the Constantines guitarist&#39;s recently released LP <em>Dark Blue</em>.

The band commented in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;I Can&#39;t Remember My Name&#39; suggests we are lost and don&#39;t understand our position in this new world, but the lyrics tell the opposite. Instead of being consumed by society, we preserve everything that makes us Indigenous by staying true to ourselves through all the bullshit.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The Rez Kids are a duo pairing Darren &#39;Young D&#39; Metz and Quinton &#39;Yung Trybez&#39; Nyce. <em>Trapline</em>, which also includes the earlier single &quot;Creator Made An Animal,&quot; follows up on the band&#39;s Polaris-shortlisted LP <em>The Average Savage</em>. It arrives May 10.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Q6jZ_nqT94" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/3Q6jZ_nqT94" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Snotty Nose Rez Kids - &quot;I Can&#39;t Remember My Name&quot; (ft.

It&#39;s the veteran band&#39;s eighth LP and is due for a September 27 release from <a href="https://www.collectedworksrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Collected Works Records</a> and <a href="https://concord.com/" class="" target=_blank>Concord</a>. The 11-song record follows the BC group&#39;s 2017 album <em>Whiteout Conditions</em>.</p><p>The announcement also shared the record&#39;s first single, &quot;Falling Down the Stairs of Your Smile.&quot; You can stream it below. Frontman <a href="https://www.acnewman.net/" class="" target=_blank>AC Newman</a> commented on the song in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;There are so many songs like &#39;the something of love&#39;—you know, there&#39;s &#39;The Book of Love,&#39; &#39;The Freeway of Love&#39;... Then I thought of &#39;falling down the stairs of your love,&#39; and I thought, that kind of works, I think it has that element of how do you deal with the ideas of love and happiness in this world right now? When current events are stressful, that makes a stress on people&#39;s relationships, and you&#39;re trying to figure out how to be happy in this loving relationship in this world that seems ugly at every turn, which is not as easy as it seems. So I like the metaphor of love as something that you fall down.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>He further explored a car theme that emerged as the album was assembled:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I was about two-thirds of the way through the record when I began to notice that lyrically so much of it was pointing toward car songs. The opening track is &#39;You&#39;ll Need a Backseat Driver&#39;, and that was a metaphor that seemed to be running through other songs, too. Next to the love song, I feel like the car song is one of the most iconic kinds of songs in pop music, from Chuck Berry to the present. There was so much of that throughout it that I started thinking: &#39;Oh, no, there&#39;s too many references to cars on this record!&#39; And then I thought, &#39;No, that&#39;s good—people might think it&#39;s a concept album.&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band has several tour dates lined up in the US and Canada this summer and fall to support the release (with regards to the band&#39;s transient live lineups, this trek is expected to include Neko Case, but not Dan Bejar). The itinerary notably includes an August 17 show at Toronto&#39;s Danforth Music Hall as part of that venue&#39;s 100th-anniversary celebrations. The New Porns will also headline the Friday night main stage of <a href="https://beaus.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Beau&#39;s</a> <a href="https://www.beausoktoberfest.ca" class="" target=_blank>Oktoberfest</a> on September 20 in Vankleek Hill, Ontario.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UqDO6DWldpw" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/UqDO6DWldpw" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: The New Pornographers - &quot;Falling Down The Stairs of Your Smile&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Experimental Montreal post-rock group <a href="http://cstrecords.com/fly-pan-am/" class="" target=_blank>Fly Pan Am</a> have another new song online previewing their upcoming reunion record <em>C&#39;est ça</em>.

Multi-instrumentalist Eric Gingras joined the group in 2002.

Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegreyestates.com/blog/video-another-shot-pretty-matty" class="" target=_blank>The Grey Estates</a>, bandleader Matty Morand commented on the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Another Shot was the first song that I wrote for the record and I think it sort of set the direction of the rest of the songs. The song is about struggling to meet the expectations that you set for yourself. Making a plan and letting it fall apart, being unable to deal with confrontation etc. and the way that those things pile up and make it harder and harder to be the person that you want to be.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Pretty Matty will play a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/716341102129819/" class="" target=_blank>record release show</a> at Toronto&#39;s Owls Club on September 21 with support from <a href="http://pipermaru.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Piper Maru</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/babybandtheband/" class="" target=_blank>Baby Band</a>, and <a href="https://tearoom.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tea Room</a>. &quot;Another Shot&quot; follows the December-released single &quot;Kicked Out,&quot; along with a four-song self-titled EP from March of 2018.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9fs4sbUiW8" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/h9fs4sbUiW8" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Pretty Matty - &quot;Another Shot&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto synthpop trio <a href="http://saunaaa.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Sauna</a> recently premiered a unique new video for the song &quot;Carousel,&quot; a cut from their recently released self-titled EP. In a statement, director Dan Tahmizian commented on the piece:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Carousel&#39; is about the cyclical nature of life and how we seem to find ourselves making the same mistakes over and over falling back into familiar patterns and mind states. The video was inspired by the Suprematist art movement, specifically a short film by Lutz Becker, and was created using one of the earliest forms of filmmaking, the Zoetrope. It consists of 25 unique handmade Zoetropes playing 16 frames loops each lasting just over 1 second long.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Sauna features Michael le Riche of <a href="https://fakepalms-pleasence.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fake Palms</a> on vocals and various electronics, performing with <a href="https://www.weavesband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Weaves</a> bassist Zach Bines and <a href="https://greys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Greys</a> drummer Braeden Craig. The group worked with Brian Borcherdt of <a href="https://www.holyfuckmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Holy Fuck</a> on the recordings. Both Borcherdt and le Riche were recently featured in an article at <a href="https://www.talkhouse.com/introducing-saunas-carousel/" class="" target=_blank>Talkhouse</a> where the two discuss the record, the band&#39;s future recording plans, the recent reunion of Borcherdt&#39;s early band <a href="https://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/burnt-black-on-fire-again/Content?oid=22156486" class="" target=_blank>Burnt Black</a>, and more.

You can watch the short, directed by frontman Brandon Williams, below.</p><p>The single artwork shared for &quot;The Girls I Know Don&#39;t Think So&quot; features an image of the Marxist revolutionary Alexandra Kollonta. Williams commented on the influence she had on the project:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;She was way ahead of her time. She fought for women&#39;s equality in the workforce, universal maternity care and women&#39;s advancement in education. She won. In 1920, Soviet Russia was the first country in the world to make abortion legal under women&#39;s request. Homosexuality was decriminalized, sex work too. This was 100 years ago, it&#39;s fucked how long it&#39;s taken the rest of the world. Alexandra Kollontai helped to change the lives of millions of people. There may be voices similar to hers out there today. Are we listening?&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Home Made Satan</em> arrives on September 13 from <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a> and <a href="http://www.capturedtracks.com/" class="" target=_blank>Captured Tracks</a>.

Recording out of London, Ontario, Brake seems cursed to singlehandedly churn out more material than any single group could hope to contain. This year alone, he&#39;s contributed to new tunes from the power-pop group <a href="https://isolationparty.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Is√∂lation Party</a>, the three-piece garage-punk act <a href="https://mononegatives.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Mononegatives</a>, the similarly motivated two-piece <a href="https://klazo.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Klazo</a>, and a surf rock side-project dubbed <a href="https://hookandthecreeps.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Hook and the Creeps</a>. On top of that, he remains an active member of the glam-punk act <a href="https://dongvegan.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dong Vegan</a>. Oh, and then there&#39;s solo material on top of that. Quite frankly, I&#39;m unclear on how one individual manages that level of creative plate spinning. Hell, I can barely get this newsletter out weekly, and 80% of that&#39;s just copying and pasting links from Bandcamp.</p><p>I suppose I shouldn&#39;t feed his addiction, but I happen to be absolutely <em>down</em> for the 70s-indebted punk sound that&#39;s so broken the mind of Robbie Brake. I&#39;m thus thrilled to debut the latest band in his legion: the spastic synth-punk act <a href="https://isolationparty.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Telegenic Pleasure</a>! The group&#39;s a duo, bridging London, Ontario and its&#39; namesake over in the United Kingdom. From that side of the pond, Telegenic Pleasure features the blown-out vocals of Marco Palumbo Rodriguez. You may know him from <a href="https://wandarecords.bandcamp.com/album/gag-on-this-the-complete-singles" class="" target=_blank>The Gaggers</a> and <a href="https://miscalculations.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Miscalculations</a>.</p><p>Brake tracked Telegenic Pleasure&#39;s breakneck instrumentals in a converted pantyhose factory in London (Ontario). Rodriguez recorded his cyborg yelps on his end, with engineer Preston Lobzun mixing the results somewhere in between (let&#39;s assume some third London, because why not). The results have roots in the Buzzcocks and Devo, finding common cause with the robot armies of The Spits, The Epoxies, Dutchess Says, and New Vogue.</p><p>The band&#39;s 8-track debut is due for an official release in mid-November from <a href="http://www.nofrontteeth.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>No Front Teeth Records</a>. As Brake&#39;s unable to take his foot off the gas, a second 12-song sophomore full length is expected to follow in 2020.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1279334412/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://telegenicpleasure.bandcamp.com/album/telegenic-pleasure">Telegenic Pleasure by Telegenic Pleasure</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://telegenicpleasure.bandcamp.com/album/telegenic-pleasure" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Telegenic Pleasure - &quot;Sealed Off&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Solem Vancouver indie rock act <a href="https://woolworm.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Woolworm</a> recently shared the second new single from <em>Awe</em>. Titled &quot;Let Me Wear The Mask,&quot; the song will appear on upcoming 12-song full-length, the band&#39;s third LP. It arrives on November 8 from <a href="https://www.mintrecs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mint Records</a>.</p><p>In a statement frontman Giles Roy commented on the track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song felt like it was about so many different things during the writing process, and it ended up being sort of abstract as a result. When we play it, I think of my own destructive tendencies, as well my attempts to curb them with what amounts to dishonesty. Sometimes I find genuine release in that escapism. That said, hopefully people will find their own meaning here. That&#39;s really what I want for all of our music.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Woolworm recorded and mixed this record with their Mint labelmate <a href="https://jayarner.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jay Arner</a>. The new set follows the group&#39;s 2017 LP <em>Deserve to Die</em>, but strikes a decidedly different tone than that hardcore-influenced sophomore effort. A record release show has been scheduled for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2322877178022891/" class="" target=_blank>November 15</a> at the Red Gate in Vancouver, with support from Juice, Outpatient, and Kamikaze Nurse.</p><p>Woolworm features Giles Roy on guitars and vocals, guitarist Alex Pomeroy, bassist Heather Black, and drummer Nick Tolliday.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3845227047/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=2839694658/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://woolworm.bandcamp.com/album/awe">AWE by WOOLWORM</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://woolworm.bandcamp.com/track/let-me-wear-the-mask" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Woolworm - &quot;Let Me Wear The Mask&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Peter Johnson of the Toronto post-hardcore act <a href="https://low--sun.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Low Sun</a> is hitting the road this week in his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tang_internet_propaganda/" class="" target=_blank>Tang</a> guise for a tour of the U.S. midwest. He&#39;ll be playing alongside Milwaukee&#39;s <a href="https://cairnsmke.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Cairns</a>. This will be Johnson&#39;s first solo tour as the pensive, lo-fi Tang, promising a set filled with &quot;scratchy 4 track loops&quot; and &quot;warm, droney experimentation[s] of songs&quot; re-interpreted from the band&#39;s studio recordings. The tour kicks off on the 23rd and runs through the 27th with shows in Wisconsin and Michigan. Check Tang&#39;s website for the full routing.</p><p>To help promote the trek, Tang released a video featuring a new song, recorded live at The Be Droom (your guess is as good as mine for what or where that is, but it sounds suitably ominous). A full-band version of the song, titled &quot;Blurred Landscape,&quot; is due to appear on Tang&#39;s next full-length. You can check out this version out below.</p><p>The upcoming Tang record is due in December from <a href="https://www.artoftheuncarvedblock.com/" class="" target=_blank>Art of the Uncarved Block</a>.

The twelve-track collection of sound collages is the result of a series of field recordings recorded over the past five years. Each track showcases a different town, with recordings made in Canada, the U.S., and Italy. <a href="https://alreadydeadtapes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Already Dead Tapes</a> will release <em>Radio Songs</em> as a cassette on November 1. The label commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Here, Bardon&#39;t&#39;s haunting vocals are absent ‚Äî these twelve tracks feature only radio and field recordings, layered, collaged, sampled back, slowed, or recorded straight in one shot. Inspired by DJ Screw, Maria Chavez, Christian Marclay, and Nike7up, these noise and pop compositions dial into the radio as an emotional barometer of place and time.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can preview &quot;I Wonder,&quot; the track Jax crafted from the aural flotsam of Toronto, below.</p><p>Along with Brigitte Bardon&#39;t, Jax has worked on the multi-media project O / L, the radio series <a href="http://kristeljax.com/poolside.html" class="" target=_blank>Infinite Poolside</a>, and the <a href="http://kristeljax.com/therapy.html" class="" target=_blank>Drone Therapy Podcast</a>.

It&#39;s a 9-song set that includes &quot;The Holder&quot; (we previewed that one in the summer) and the title track that you can hear below.</p><p>A press release from the label attempts to encapsulate the low-key group&#39;s sound, claiming:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;...soft sounds to dent skin and flesh. The music is naked and exquisitely personal, threatening banality, but mainly an embrace of the commune. Dramatic and confidential anthems of divine insignificance. Across three studio albums the project has explored the nature of intimacy with tiny confessions released into vast lakes of sound. Simple songs punctuated by clusters of detail. The project is built on contradictions: traditional yet modern; miniscule yet infinite; proud but deflated. Something for everyone and nothing to no one. A search for peace?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>ANAMAI&#39;s atmospheric, minimalist folk music comes courtesy of Anna Mayberry (formerly of Toronto sludge punks <a href="https://hsy666.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>HSY</a>) and David Psutka (of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/egyptrixx" class="" target=_blank>Egyptrixx</a> and ACT!).

In a statement the band commented on the tune:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;[Hide &amp; Seek] is all about recreating the excitement of your first taste of adolescent independence. The room was dark, and faint whispers made their way to your ears from mysterious directions. The time for silence was nigh, however. The game was about to start. We&#39;re playing hide and seek, and that feeling of the neverending night ahead was like a rare, illicit elixir. Who knows what&#39;s in store?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Like the earlier released &quot;Such Slime,&quot; this track features a retro-styled video from Issac Roberts. Nutrients started as a Montreal-based bedroom-pop project from vocalist Taylor Teeple. Since relocating to Toronto, Teepe&#39;s built out a full band featuring guitarist Will Hunter, drummer Turner Wigginton, bassist Sean McKee, and keyboardist Iulia Ciobanu.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lT1aELU3wVc" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/lT1aELU3wVc" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Nutrients - &quot;Hide &amp; Seek&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p><a href="https://casperskulls.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Casper Skulls</a>&#39; vocalist Melanie St-Pierre recently debuted a solo act with the name of <a href="https://lloop.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>l&#39;loop</a>.

St-Pierre commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I started l&#39;loop in the spring of 2019 while I was writing the rest of the new Casper Skulls record. I wanted to get more familiar with recording myself and exploring my love for ambient. While Casper may be bold, l&#39;loop is tender and lo-fi.

The track (which boasts some serious Cranberries vibes) reflects upon the religious upbringing of guitarist/vocalist Chrisy Hurn. She commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Think about &#39;Have I Been Deceived&#39; as an open letter to God. This past year, I have been feeling like I was brainwashed. I was taught to think in a particular manner, taught to love in a specific way, taught to think about my body and sexuality in a specific (ahem oppressive) way, and quite honestly at the time, I ate that shit up. I was the girl in highschool trying to convert all my friends, telling everyone to stay abstinent, listening to every Christian band that sounded almost as good as the real thing. That was my entire identity. Throughout my twenties, this identity fell apart.</p><p>I&#39;ve become increasingly uncomfortable with who I was, so much that being around any type of Christian culture, makes me feel nauseous, or worse.</p><p>I want to let that go, I want to think clearly about faith, but I am afraid that I am not able to. I am afraid that I was gaslighted into loving something that is wrong or an ugly version of something that could be good. I don&#39;t know who I am without my past. I don&#39;t know who I am moving forward. I wish I had a more clear answer but I don&#39;t; I am just here.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Basement Revolver recorded with producer Ian Gomes (Greys, Frigs, Odonis Odonis). The group features Chrisy Hurn on vocals and guitar, guitarist Jonathan Malstr√∂m, bassist Nimal Agalawatte, and drummer Brandon Munro.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p6zOQZSn7qA" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/p6zOQZSn7qA" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Basement Revolver - &quot;Have I Been Deceived&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Speaking of 90s vibes, there&#39;s a new single out from Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://maybekindasorta.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Maybe Kinda Sorta</a>, a preview of that project&#39;s forthcoming EP. &quot;Sit Around&quot; will appear on the matter-of-factly titled <em>Another EP</em>, which is due on Halloween.</p><p>Maybe Kinds Sorta is the songwriting project of Brent Fulop, the former drummer for the now-defunct Welland, Ontario punk group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thesnipsmusic/" class="" target=_blank>The Snips</a>.

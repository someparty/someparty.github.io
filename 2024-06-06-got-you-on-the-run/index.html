From day to day, I&#39;m lurching clumsily from one responsibility to the next, somehow successfully ticking off the unnegotiable boxes, but only just so. When I started Some Party, I knew the daily Punknews coverage treadmill had become untenable, so I counterprogrammed. I designed a system that practically beseeches me to ignore it. It&#39;s my neglect engine - out of step as a feature. So, while the newsletter, or the lack thereof, rarely causes me much stress, there are times when a prior issue is so glaringly distant that I feel the need to admonish myself publicly. That&#39;s especially true when updates from artists I&#39;ve cherished for decades start piling up.</p><p>I&#39;ve reached that point. So here I am, resetting the clock, taking my lumps, and feebly chipping away at the backlog. My apologies, good people of the Dominion of Canada.</p><h3 id=cuff_the_duke><span class=artist-title><a href="https://cufftheduke.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Cuff The Duke</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Got You On The Run&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/D94GeBH7aLE?si=KTzsVCDnLG463wdf" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://cufftheduke.bandcamp.com/album/breaking-dawn" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>I lived in Guelph during the early aughts, contemporaneous to Three Gut Records&#39; short but impactful lifespan. I was in the Royal City at the right time and place (entirely by accident), and few labels occupy such a hallowed place in my canon. While this newsletter&#39;s given me ample opportunity to tout my Cons fandom, I&#39;ve rarely had the opportunity to fawn over their labelmates <a href="https://cufftheduke.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Cuff The Duke</a>. I wore through my <em>Life Stories for Minimum Wage</em> CD in the summer of 2002. The band&#39;s sometimes quirky mix of roots elements and guitar squawl spoke to a shared conversation in Canadian music at the time - reverberating among folky punk hybrids like The Weakerthans, Jon Rae and the River, the Sadies, and (a bit later) Attack In Black.</p><p>This September, the group returns from their decade-plus hiatus. <em>Breaking Dawn</em> lands September 6 as the band&#39;s seventh full-length, launching their new label Cardinal Records with a dozen songs. Wayne Petti&#39;s vocals are instantly familiar on the lead single &quot;Got You On The Run.&quot; The artist commented on the song in an Instagram post:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is one of a few songs on the record that had been floating around for years and never finished. My first demo of it was from 2015! I had the chorus written but not the verses. All the songs on this record are mostly my reflections on my own mental health, and this was really the first song I wrote that addresses that. When I wrote, &#39;I add it up day by day, the over-under odds I play and when it hits, I can never say but oh I got you, I got you on the run&#39; I knew that the song was going to be about how my anxiety had a way of creeping in at unpredictable times or at least it seemed that way. The feeling of always being chased by those feelings because they weren&#39;t being addressed.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A video for the track repurposes old Super 8 film footage shot by Petti&#39;s grandfather in the 60s. <a href="https://ohboywonder.com" class="" target=_blank>Boy Wonder</a> compiled and directed the visuals.</p><p>Emerging in Oshawa, Ontario in the early 2000s, Cuff The Duke last issued the <em>Union</em> LP in 2012, sandwiched between two EPs of cover songs (<em>In Our Time</em> and <em>In Our Time Part II</em>).</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1324178275/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://cufftheduke.bandcamp.com/album/breaking-dawn">Breaking Dawn by Cuff The Duke</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=nap_eyes><span class=artist-title><a href="https://napeyes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Nap Eyes</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Feline Wave Race&quot; / &quot;Ice Grass Underpass&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://napeyes.bandcamp.com/album/feline-wave-race" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>When we last heard from <a href="https://napeyes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Nap Eyes</a>, the celebrated indie rockers were putting their pensive spin on classics by Bonnie Raitt and (somewhat unexpectedly) Green Day. Three years out from 2021&#39;s <em>When I Come Around</em> EP, the Halifax-rooted band is back with a slate of new material and the promise of a new LP.</p><p>&quot;Ice Grass Underpass,&quot; written by Nigel Chapman in 2009, predates the group&#39;s formation and heralds the sound they&#39;d establish on 2015&#39;s <em>Whine of the Mystic</em>. It appears here in its first official capacity, with the crunch and squeal of Brad Loughead&#39;s guitar supporting Chapman&#39;s signature deadpan. The expansive &quot;Feline Wave Race&quot; bookends the group&#39;s songwriting journey, the product of contemporary sessions focused on improvisation and nonlinear narratives. &quot;Wave Race&quot; came together in Windsor, NS, with Loughead mixing in Los Angeles. The group recorded &quot;Ice Grass&quot; in Montreal with <a href="https://faithhealer.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Faith Healer</a>&#39;s <a href="http://rennywilson.com/" class="" target=_blank>Renny Wilson</a>.

These new tracks and the album they foreshadow arrive again via POB.

With the loss still raw, Rick celebrated his longtime collaborator with a faithful album of Sadies covers. This summer brings the artists closer still with the arrival of a communal album of brand-new material. The 13-song <em>Rick White and the Sadies</em>, recorded in the early winter months of 2024, lands this week through Rick&#39;s <a href="https://bluefogrecordings.bigcartel.com/" class="" target=_blank>Blue Fog Recordings</a>. LPs are on order now, with the digital set available early through Bandcamp.</p><p>On the project, White revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I&#39;ve always had a close relationship with The Sadies. I met Dallas Good in 96 and we hit it off right away. He played in Elevator from time to time and i did lots of artwork and song writing for the Sadies. We shared an apartment in Toronto in the early 2000&#39;s and in 2003, Me, Greg Keelor and all the Sadies recorded an album together called THE UNINTENDED. Ever since then we had plans to record another LP together but it never managed to come together before Dallas&#39;s untimely death in 2022.</p><p>Well, we&#39;ve finally done it, thirteen brand new songs filled with sweet melodies and swirling psychedelic guitars like only our special connection could create. The loss of our brother Dallas understandably focusses many of the lyrics on mortality. Of course we had him clearly on our minds while making this album. He may not have physically been here with us, but he is very much a part of it. The lyrics are about the loss of a loved one and the light and dark of life in general. We made this album to help lift us, an album we really like, an album we think Dallas would like too.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Rick White&#39;s best known for his time with the pioneering New Brunswick act <a href="https://www.subpop.com/artists/erics_trip" class="" target=_blank>Eric&#39;s Trip</a>. A prolific home recorder, he recently issued the minimalist new wave set <em>Music Box</em> and the feedback-drenched <em>De-Evolution</em> EP.

The eight-song <em>Starcade</em> unites vocalist/keyboardist Aley Waterman of Toronto dream-pop act <a href="https://galaa.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Galaa</a> with bassist/guitarist Scott Sheppard from island garage rockers <a href="https://therangers.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Rangers</a>. Together, they&#39;ve crafted a set of nostalgic tunes that reminisce on 90s youth culture, with the album&#39;s very title referencing a video arcade from Corner Brook&#39;s now diminished Valley Mall. That vibe&#39;s perhaps best captured in the single &quot;Skaters,&quot; a &quot;psychobabble pop-punk anthem&quot; awash in coming-of-age innocence. You can see it in a vintage-styled video with animations from artist Vasco Cavalheiro.</p><p>The band recorded with producer Phil Churchill (The Once) in 2022 at Ginger Beard House studios. <em>Starcade</em> serves as the inaugural release from <a href="https://milltownrecs.com" class="" target=_blank>Milltown Records</a>, a new <a href="https://www.lhmrec.com" class="" target=_blank>LHM Records</a> imprint focused on western Newfoundland artists.</p><h3 id=jake_nicoll><span class=artist-title><a href="https://jakenicoll.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jake Nicoll</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Lonely Mission</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://jakenicoll.bandcamp.com/album/lonely-mission" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>The aforementioned <a href="https://jakenicoll.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jake Nicoll</a> also recently issued a new solo record. You can find the nine-song <em>Lonely Mission</em> streaming everywhere. It&#39;s astonishingly the St. John&#39;s songwriter&#39;s 11th full-length. The album&#39;s spacious and intimate, a product of COVID-era mandated solitude. Don&#39;t assume, though, that it&#39;s some lo-fi basement affair—Jake&#39;s too deft a producer, and his skill&#39;s on full display. Get your headphones out. In a statement, the artist sets the scene:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The title refers to both the title track of the album and to the time of the album&#39;s creation - deep in the dark lonely depths of the pandemic. Stranded on his family farm for that first year of lock-downs and outbreaks, Jake assembled himself a studio in a cabin, built himself a number of vintage styled tube preamps, microphones and compressors and nestled into his creative cocoon. With the snowy rolling hills and farm fields as a backdrop, Jake let his creativity wander; writing, recording and experimenting with a patience that only a locked-down pandemic world could grant to an artist. Having stepped out of the endless rush of touring, producing albums, and running a recording studio, Jake found himself thinking about the larger questions of life and the future of this warming planet.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new album follows <em>Ego Trip</em>, a decidedly poppier EP issued as a teaser in February. While not working in the studio or recording solo, Nicoll performs with beloved PEI storytellers <a href="http://www.wearetheburninghell.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Burning Hell</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2844975462/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://jakenicoll.bandcamp.com/album/lonely-mission">Lonely Mission by Jake Nicoll</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=unwanted_noise><span class=artist-title><a href="https://unwantednoiseofficial.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Unwanted Noise</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Bury Me On The South Shore</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://unwantednoiseofficial.bandcamp.com/album/bury-me-on-the-south-shore" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Longueuil street punk act <a href="https://unwantednoiseofficial.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Unwanted Noise</a> has a new full-length in the wild. <em>Bury Me On The South Shore</em> clocks in with 11 new takes on the band&#39;s self-described &quot;chaos punk&quot; sound, recorded by Scott Golyardi (Force Majeure, Méfait) at Studio 440.

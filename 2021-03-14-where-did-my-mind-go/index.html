He passed last summer at the age of 57. You can preview the five-song set at the <a href="https://rakerecords.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Rake Records</a>&#39; Bandcamp page now.</p><p><em>A Blessing</em> features outtakes from the 2004 sessions that produced the band&#39;s penultimate record, <em>In the Meantime and in Between Time</em>. They feature Chi on vocals, Marc Belke on guitar, and Trevor Macgregor on drums, with bass duties split between Rob Johnson and Matt Warhurst. Marek David plays keys on the song &quot;Suddenly,&quot; with founding guitarist Brent Belke returning to the fold to perform on &quot;Hale Bop.&quot; That track also features three-quarters of Winnipeg activist-punk heroes <a href="https://propagandhi.com/" class="" target=_blank>Propagandhi</a>, with Chris Hannah playing guitar and contributing backing vocals alongside Todd Kowalski and Jord Samolesky.</p><p>The digital set is the first major archival release from the group following Chi&#39;s death. It follows the heartwrenching acoustic track &quot;Cement Mixer,&quot; a farewell song the frontman had saved for this eventuality. SNFU released their eighth and final studio album, <em>Never Trouble Trouble Until Trouble Troubles You</em>, in 2013.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2827981806/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://rakerecords.bandcamp.com/album/a-blessing-but-with-it-a-curse">A Blessing But With It A Curse by SNFU</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=odonis_odonis><span class=artist-title><a href="https://odonisodonis.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Odonis Odonis</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Get Out&quot; / &quot;Salesmen&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://odonisodonis.bandcamp.com/album/spectrums" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Restless Toronto industrial outfit <a href="https://odonisodonis.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Odonis Odonis</a> have undergone yet another evolution. The group emerges from the pandemic paired back to a duo of founding players Dean Tzenos and Denholm Whale. The band will service their fifth album, <em>Spectrums</em>, in October through LA&#39;s <a href="http://www.felte.net" class="" target=_blank>Felte</a>, following up on their 2019 EP <em>Reaction</em> and 2017&#39;s <em>No Pop</em> full-length.</p><p>The release marks another shift in the band&#39;s sound, augmenting the apocalyptic synth-scapes and EBM-thump of their recent material with shades of darkwave and 80s goth. Tzenos commented on this latest change in the band&#39;s recent bio:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This project is the start of the third chapter of the band&#39;s evolution. I still feel like we have a lot more to explore musically and writing these songs lit the spark for a lot of new directions. The idea of doing something poppy is a stark contrast to our last record, but as long as the project remains fun and experimental it will keep growing. We&#39;re more like the weird goth kids in the back of the club now.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Whale reflected:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Despite our massive changes there has always been a cohesive thread between all of the band&#39;s material, whether it be programmed drums or epic reverberated swells. I would say the band that has existed since <em>Post Plague</em> now feels like a separate project. We&#39;ve learned a lot over the years, about what&#39;s important both as a band and as someone who wants to make music part of their life. We&#39;ve finally found where we fit inside all of the noise.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band plans to release previews of the record in batches, thematically colour-coded to match the emotional thrust of the material. March brings us &quot;Get Out&quot; and &quot;Salesmen,&quot; two-song wrapped in crimson, awash in passion and anger. You can preview both now at Bandcamp.</p><p>When they&#39;re able to return to the stage, Odonis Odonis will perform live as a trio with live drummer Phil Wilson.</p><p>During the pandemic, Denholm Whale released several recordings under his solo guise <a href="https://scratch.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Scratch</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=326710460/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://odonisodonis.bandcamp.com/album/spectrums">Spectrums by Odonis Odonis</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=roy><span class=artist-title><a href="https://thesoundofroy.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>ROY</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Where Did My Mind Go?&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://thesoundofroy.bandcamp.com/track/where-did-my-mind-go" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> - Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/IaUnEW0iIzs" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>The enigmatic Toronto psych-pop act <a href="https://thesoundofroy.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>ROY</a> returns this year with <em>Roy&#39;s Garage</em>. The new 13-song full-length comes on the heels of <em>Peace Love and Outer Space</em>, a lush celestial concept album released last year. While no less heady, the new work promises a more grounded approach - appearing to set aside the benevolent aliens and higher-dimensional concerns of its predecessor.</p><p>The announcement arrived along with the single &quot;Where Did My Mind Go?&quot;, a track that label <a href="https://www.ideefixerecords.com" class="" target=_blank>Idée Fixe</a> touts as a &quot;Wilson-esque pocket symphony.&quot; It&#39;s showcased in a new video from director Sam Maloney, one that&#39;s both appropriately trippy and suitably vintage in its kaleidoscopic trappings. <a href="https://www.shindig-magazine.com/" class="" target=_blank>Shindig! Magazine</a> premiered the clip, commenting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;this 2 minute wonder is a beautifully melodic ode dischronometria, or could it be something more otherworldly? Mesmeric organ stabs, lush strings and some suitably wobbly fuzz guitar sit alongside a falsetto voice pleading for answers. Lovely.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In a statement, ROY mastermind Patrick Lefler commented on the new work:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Roy&#39;s Garage exists inside everybody&#39;s mind. It is where you keep your fondest memories and your darkest secrets. I hope it is a place of exploration and healing. Also a space to hold yourself accountable and learn how to be new again; there is never a bad moment to go to the Garage.</p><p>I&#39;ve been through changes in my life and wanted to create a snapshot of my feelings through 60s and 70s sounds. Every album I create is a loaf of bread, baking in a world where temperature and humidity constantly fluctuate. It can&#39;t be recreated.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Idée Fixe Records has the vinyl edition of <em>Roy&#39;s Garage</em> lined up for a May 14 release.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IaUnEW0iIzs" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=tda><span class=artist-title><a href="https://tda444.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>TDA</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Présence&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/R_UkU2nGg0A" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://tda444.bandcamp.com/track/pr-sence" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Montreal&#39;s Trafic des airs, the industrial/no wave side-project of <a href="https://victimelol.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>VICTIME</a> drummer Samuel Gougoux, returns next month with their first full length. Recently renamed <a href="https://tda444.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>TDA</a>, the group&#39;s set to release <em>Ascète</em> on April 23 through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MichelRecords/" class="" target=_blank>Michel Records</a>. You can stream &quot;Présence,&quot; the commanding and percussive lead single, through Bandcamp now. A press release describes an album fueled by Gougoux&#39;s exploration of the forests of Bas-St-Laurent at night:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Trying to shed normative fears, he decides to start exploring the forests at night, and questions this state of stupor, stemming from his childhood, fascinated by the architectural, but also percussive, aspects of trees... This peculiar energy is transposed on the album with a sense of minimalistic urgency and syncopated, abrasive melodies, inspired by the branches and the light patterns emanating through the shadows.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Ascète</em> arrives on vinyl packaged with a photo zine documenting some of the scenery that inspired the work. The nine-song set features Gougoux on just about everything (vocals, percussion, guitar, synths, bass and violin), with Linsey Wellman appearing on sax. The new record follows TDA&#39;s self-titled 2019 EP. If you were into those Odonis Odonis tracks above, this should be next in your playlist.</p><p>As a member of <a href="https://victimelol.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>VICTIME</a>, Samuel Gougoux last released <em>Mi-tronc, mi-jambe</em> in 2019.

You can hear &quot;Radiation,&quot; a gorgeous goth-styled earworm, on Bandcamp now. O&#39;Neill&#39;s vocals absolutely soar on this one, providing a perfect counterpoint to the sinister electronics pushing the song forward.

Heitmann painted the EP&#39;s cover art, channelling the German painter Sigmar Polke. The band notes that Polke &quot;experimented with a wide range of materials like arsenic, meteor dust and uranium rays,&quot; making his influence an apt thematic fit for <em>Radiation</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3471434471/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://darktimemusic.bandcamp.com/album/radiation">Radiation by Dark Time</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=matt_post_band><span class=artist-title><a href="https://mattpostband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Matt Post Band</a></span><span class=media-title><em>EP</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://mattpostband.bandcamp.com/album/ep" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Matt Post of the Whitby-bred noise-punk duo <a href="https://buysomedeathsticks.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Deathsticks</a> recently debuted new solo material as the <a href="https://mattpostband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Matt Post Band</a>, sharing a five-song self-titled EP.

In a statement Link commented on the duality of the record, which combines pre-pandemic material with songs written in isolation:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The album is a meeting of old and new. Old songs from a year ago where I&#39;m having really horrifyingly awful days at work, getting doored while biking in Toronto and flying into the middle of the street, or going on dates with guys who I&#39;m either instantly in love with, or who end up creeping me out a bit. Those songs are more packed with that feeling of hurtling-through-time-and-space-at-breakneck-speed, manic energy. The newer songs are infused with a foggier, slower-paced disillusionment, and deal with the strangeness of a reality morphing before my eyes every day. I still try to be optimistic obviously, but these songs are really glorified coping mechanisms.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The announcement came alongside the new single &quot;Silvertongue,&quot; as showcased in a video co-directed by Link and Graeme Leung. It follows &quot;Hangman&quot; in previewing the record.</p><p>With roots as Link&#39;s bedroom recording project, PACKS grew over the past few years into a full band. Recent recordings have featured Madeline backed by guitarist Dexter Nash, bassist Noah O&#39;Neil, and drummer Shane Hooper.

Last summer, with his usually relentless tour schedule sidelined, Jones completed and released a long-simmering set of experimental &quot;vocal noise&quot; tracks under the name <a href="https://throatfuneral.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Throat Funeral</a>. The 10-song <em>OU812112</em> featured collaborations with Norwegian artist Jørgen Munkeby, avant-garde Nunavut vocalist <a href="http://tanyatagaq.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tanya Tagaq</a>, and Seattle grunge vet Tad Doyle.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TX_Wv9-KO4o" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=capable><span class=artist-title><a href="https://capable.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Capable!</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Brûle Brûle Brûle</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and Purchase at <a href="https://capable.bandcamp.com/album/br-le-br-le-br-le" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Montreal punk quartet <a href="https://capable.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Capable!</a> recently issued their fourth EP, the six-song <em>Brûle Brûle Brûle</em>. The quartet recorded live-off-the-floor in a single day (which they attribute more to budget than some quest for authenticity). The band commented at Bandcamp that the set tackles a pre-pandemic set of issues, perhaps offering a reprieve from the omnipresent problems of today:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Que vous soyez en burn-out, que l&#39;argent vous brûle les doigts ou que vous ayez des brûlements d&#39;estomac, Brûle Brûle Brûle vous fera oublier la pandémie en vous rappelant tous vos problèmes de 2019! En effet, les sujets comme : chercher des papiers pour les impôts de v&#39;là 2 ans, faire une crise d&#39;angoisse dans le métro et ne pas avoir d&#39;argent pour s&#39;acheter des affaires sont abordés.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Capable! has roots further north in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, with members previously appearing in the Rouyn Noranda punk group <a href="https://lessprates.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Les Sprates</a>.

You can preview &quot;Re-Veil&quot; through a new video co-directed by Lee and Dylan Gamble (of Toronto psych-rockers <a href="http://hotgarbagemusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Hot Garbage</a>). Sook-Yin commented on the track and the new visuals in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The song &#39;Re-Veil&#39; is a romantic and sobering rumination on love and the desire to keep it alive while letting go. Drawing inspiration from the Chanson Triste style of 60s French pop songs in the tradition of Serge Gainsbourg and Françoise Hardy, the past and future meet through electronic music. The music video by Lee &amp; Gamble immerses the viewer on a vibrant and tumultuous path of self-reconciliation. Symbolic imagery gives a wink and nod to neo-noir classics &#39;Blue Velvet&#39; and &#39;L.A. Confidential&#39;, Czech surrealist fantasy horror film &#39;Valerie and Her Week of Wonders&#39; and German Expressionism.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Following Litovitz&#39;s death in June of 2019, Lee worked with engineer Steve Chahley (Partner, Ice Cream, U.S. Girls) to complete the album. The set serves as the sequel to <em>jooj</em>, an atmospheric electronic record that Lee and Litovitz debuted back in 2015. The eleven-song <em>jooj two</em> arrives April 9 through Mint.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5oYR2GaQSM" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=the_fly_downs><span class=artist-title><a href="https://theflydowns.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Fly Downs</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Head Held High&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/tsEiecmGfF4" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://thousandislandsrecords.bandcamp.com/album/at-this-point-in-time" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Ottawa melodic punk trio <a href="https://theflydowns.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Fly Downs</a> have a new video online showcasing &quot;Head Held High,&quot; the latest single from their upcoming <a href="https://thousandislandsrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Thousand Islands</a> debut <em>At This Point In Time</em>.

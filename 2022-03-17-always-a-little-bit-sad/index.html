That dry spell ends on April 1 with the independent release of a new record, the mostly acoustic <em>Goodbye Nightlife</em>. The album finds the group reflecting on the excess of youth, looking back at their time on the road through the lense of age. You can hear two previews at Bandcamp now. &quot;Always a Little Bit Sad&quot; and &quot;Money &amp; Guitars&quot; suggest a nostalgic outlook. The latter sells it with a well-placed guest appearance by Frankie Stubbs of the gruff UK legends Leatherface - who even in his youth carried the weight of the world in his raspy vocals.</p><p>Stubbs is one of several guests who took part in the record. It also features Felicity Hamer (United Steel Workers of Montreal), Keith Douglas (Mariachi el Bronx, Mad Caddies), Cleo Beauchamp-Paquette (Miracles), Ryan Battistuzzi, Joe Grass, and Margaret Tracteur. Rich Bouthillier and Marc-Andr√© Beaudet of The Sainte Catherines, of course, play a role. Given that the gang&#39;s all here, fans of the early-2000s punk act should undoubtedly take note. That band hasn&#39;t been regularly active in a decade either, last releasing the <em>Fire Works</em> LP in 2010.</p><p>The legend goes that Yesterday&#39;s Ring formally came together in Memphis, Tennessee, founded in 2000 as an offshoot of the then-touring Sainte Catherines by singer Hugo Mudie, guitarist Fred Jacques, and guitarist Louis Valiquette. The band last released <em>Chasers</em> in 2010, a record that revisited earlier songs with the group&#39;s then-seven-piece lineup.</p><p>Befitting their present-day status as wistful old codgers, the group&#39;s scheduled a responsibly restrained handful of tour dates to support the record. Those shows will see Yesterday&#39;s Ring accompanied by <a href="https://lostlove.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lost Love</a>&#39;s solo frontman <a href="https://www.guilhemmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Guilhem</a> over the next few months. They&#39;re primarily sticking to their home province, other than a single date in Toronto. The run kicks off on April 9 at L&#39;Anti in Quebec City.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shWRRKjhbKE" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=shoulder_season><span class=artist-title><a href="https://shoulderseasonhfx.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Shoulder Season</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Dominoes&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://shoulderseasonhfx.bandcamp.com/track/dominoes" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>I didn&#39;t set out to make age and maturity a running thread in this week&#39;s mailing, but Dartmouth&#39;s <a href="https://shoulderseasonhfx.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Shoulder Season</a> referred to themselves as an &quot;adult women punk band&quot; in a recent email, so I&#39;m going to run with it.

In a press release, the band commented on the track, penned and sung by Karen Foster (also of <a href="https://safeword4.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Safeword</a>). They muse:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;What happens when the whole world loses a collective sense of what&#39;s normal, right and wrong? Changes that bring progress‚Äîthe loosening hold of religion, the diversification in where we get our news and information ‚Äîalso have a double edge, because it&#39;s hard to know how to behave when no one is following the same rules or working with the same facts. As we watch our beliefs, and our sense that they&#39;re widely shared, come tumbling down like dominoes: how do we continue to understand and live with each other?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The group recorded at Ocean Floor in Halifax. Rob Seaton of the Sudbury power-pop legends Statues Statues mixed and mastered the track with assistance from Jordy Oswald.</p><p>&quot;Dominoes&quot; arrives just a little less than a year out from the group&#39;s sole 2021 single, &quot;Deep Fake.&quot; Shoulder Season features Karen Foster on keyboards and vocals, Mel Sturk (<a href="https://thejohnnies.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Johnnies</a>, Yuma County) on guitar and vocals, Kristina Parlee (<a href="https://themaynards.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Maynards</a>, <a href="https://smallerhearts.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Smaller Hearts</a>) on bass, and the ever-in-demand Meg Yoshida drumming.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1146096591/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://shoulderseasonhfx.bandcamp.com/track/dominoes">Dominoes by Shoulder Season</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=seth_a_smith><span class=artist-title><a href="https://campsite.bio/sth_smth" class="" target=_blank>Seth A.

Four songs feature renditions of music from the Baroque composer Domenico Scarlatti, with producer and Dog Day member Nancy Urich playing piano and harpsichord.</p><p>Smith directed the film, which he co-wrote with Darcy Spidle. The claustrophobic thriller stars Anna Hopkins (from <em>The Expanse</em>) in a plot that (for better or worse) coincidentally featured the horrific fallout of a global pandemic (although the fictional one sounds worse, all things considered). It was Smith and Ulrich&#39;s follow-up to their 2017 horror movie, <em>The Crescent</em>.</p><p>Dog Day, a beloved Haligonian &quot;gloom-pop&quot; quartet, last released the stellar <em>Present</em> LP in 2020 via their <a href="https://fundog.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>fundog</a> label.

Her latest single, cheekily titled &quot;Brexit at Tiffany&#39;s,&quot; finds Parks channelling Patti Smith with an engaging spoken-word delivery.</p><p>In a press release, the Toronto-born Parks commented on how the track came together:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We were recording at Rian [O&#39;Grady]&#39;s house and the guys started playing this music which had Francesco [Perini]&#39;s Ray Mananzarek Doors&#39; sensibilities and Mike [Sutton]&#39;s Neil Young-esque guitar, and then I started reading this poem I had written which pieces together definitions of words I found interesting and had written down. The title is thanks to Ruari [Meehan] who kept saying this over and over and we all thought it was the best thing we ever heard.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A video from director <a href="https://www.robertascroft.com/" class="" target=_blank>Robert Ascroft</a> showcases the track. Shot in London, where Parks is now based, it features some rather horrific English breakfast masks.</p><p>The new album&#39;s the long-awaited follow-up to Parks&#39; 2013 full-length <em>Blood Hot</em>. It&#39;s also her first solo record following a pair of collaborative LPs with Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre.

Songs like the title track or &quot;Three Dead Cedars&quot; deliver precisely what their titles promise but do so in immensely hooky, minute-long bursts. There&#39;s an innocent charm to weird little ditties like &quot;Here, Have an Egg&quot; that wouldn&#39;t be out of place on a well-crafted children&#39;s record.</p><p>From a genre standpoint, I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;d place Sheriff Birch (his press anoints his basement-recorded music as &quot;lo-fi folk-baroque-country-rock&quot;).

It worked for a few months because we both stayed at our partners&#39; houses, but when Ryan&#39;s fiance moved to Edmonton, suddenly he was home all the time.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>On the album, produced by Jon Drew (Fucked Up, METZ), the band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Since we didn&#39;t have a hard deadline to finish, we felt a lot more freedom to take our time and mess around in the studio. Jon is the kind of producer that is down to try anything, so we had lots of fun playing with trumpets, old moog synths, glockenspiels.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Not counting the <em>Expedition Denied</em> EP that surfaced amidst the frustration of the band&#39;s pandemic downtime, the new record formally follows up 2019&#39;s <em>Optimal Lifestyles</em>.

At long last, the former <a href="https://mauno.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mauno</a> member appears ready to seize the spotlight with <em>Staying Mellow Blows</em>, her debut solo long-player.

You can hear the playful lead single &quot;Sushi California&quot; now.</p><p>In a statement, Niemi commented on the quirky synth-pop track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It tells the story of two people spending the day together, each on completely different wavelengths. One is sadly thinking about their father aging, while the other is drunk on romance. It&#39;s about how the exact same interaction can feel completely different to someone depending on how they happen to project onto it. The first half of the song is playful (if not a bit delusional) as the protagonist projects affection and understanding onto their companion after a brief exchange.</p><p>The second half is pessimistic as the protagonist recounts the same exchange later in a different setting making them feel the complete opposite. There&#39;s such an element of performance to human interaction, especially in romance, and I wanted to expose the absurdity/tragedy/comedy of that in &#39;Sushi California,&#39; especially with the music video. I am alone, in my own world, goofily performing for no one -- much like the song&#39;s protagonist.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can find the accompanying video, directed by Ryan Al-Hage (Zoon, Commuted, Dorothea Paas), on YouTube.</p><p>You&#39;ll find a few familiar names among the lengthy credits of <em>Staying Mellow Blows</em>.

Featuring guest vocals from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/punk_roquette/" class="" target=_blank>√âmilie Plamondon</a> of the Punk Roquette podcast, the song addresses the 2013 train explosion that levelled Lac-M√©gantic, QC. The band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;You&#39;ve heard the story, bare minimum safety protocols, inadequate staffing, and corporate oversight leads to tragedy. Bend the iron tells the true tale of how the lack of attention caused one of the worst rail disasters in Canadian history, claiming the lives of over 45 residents and destroying a picturesque lake-side town in Quebec.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The 11-song LP arrives June 14 through Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://thousandislandsrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Thousand Islands Records</a>. The band commented on the record&#39;s overarching Canuck themes, revealing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Yes, Sorry we know we are friendly folk full of maple syrup and cheese curds. But Canada is not without its fair share of issues. A Canadian Tragedy is full of songs about love, irony, coverup, scandal, folklore and tradition all with a Canadian twist. 11 Fast melodic punk songs written with sing-along melodies and lyrics that make you go hmmm.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Since we&#39;re already leaning into Canadiana here, I should mention that one of these songs appears to be a cover of the <a href="https://www.nfb.ca/film/log_drivers_waltz/" class="" target=_blank>Log Driver&#39;s Waltz</a>.

Comedian and actor Jay Baruchel, who seems to be everywhere these days, directed the &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; video, which you can, of course, find on YouTube.</p><p>Vocalist George Pettit revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song was largely Dallas [Green&#39;s] brain child but over the course of writing this record it became more of a mission statement for the band. It&#39;s kind of about performance and embracing a new found confidence in a state of peculiarity.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band issued a collective opinion in that same regard, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;A continuous thread through the fabric of Alexisonfire is the state of otherness. Otherness drew us all to spaces where a band like this could be formed. We attract the type of individuals that have all felt the sensation of being strange or unique. Perceived or otherwise, otherness has followed us through childhood, adolescence, and into our adult lives. It drives our tastes and proclivities. It bonds us with ourselves and others. And make no mistake, even at our most domestic and mundane moments, we are true outliers.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Alexisonfire self-produced the new record, with Jonah Falco of Fucked Up and Career Suicide mixing. The group&#39;s new material follows a series of one-off singles issued since their 2019 reunion.

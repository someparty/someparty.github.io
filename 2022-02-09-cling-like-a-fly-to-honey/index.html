After some time off-grid, the scene veteran&#39;s back with a new project, debuting a super lo-fi and intensely personal EP last week as <a href="https://swampprince.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Swamp Prince</a>. The group finds Robinson on guitar and vocals, fronting a three-piece backed by bassist Kayley Moon and <a href="https://astralgunk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Astral Gunk</a>&#39;s Zakary Slax drumming. Those two play these days in the Montreal indie rock act <a href="https://feelingfigures.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Feeling Figures</a> (formerly known as the Dead Beat Poet Society - they issued a debut last year through <a href="https://celluloidlunch.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Celluloid Lunch</a>). Thomas Molander (also of Feeling Figures) engineered and mixed the trio.</p><p>Robinson commented on the self-described &quot;messy EP&quot; via Bandcamp, stating that they recorded in Montreal after practicing together just once. She revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Behold, my lisp and my discordant guitar perform the soundtrack to your next vomit. We jammed once and recorded live the next day ~ I essentially had our second band practice mastered.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>I, perhaps foolishly, endeavoured to listen to absolutely everything that hit my inbox this week, and the effort left me completely hollowed out. The brunt of what came down the PR funnel felt overly glossy and consciously manufactured for some online audience that I&#39;m clearly too old for. I&#39;m sure it was all competent and well produced by whatever TikTok metric they measure against - but it&#39;s just not for me. On the other hand, Swamp Prince isn&#39;t paying for a publicist by any means. They were only on my radar because I stumbled upon mutual acquaintances cheering them on. What they&#39;ve assembled here, however hasty, feels worlds more meaningful than anything the mechanisms of the industry pushed my way.</p><p>The Swamp Prince debut features four endearingly broken songs. It&#39;s available to pick up today at Bandcamp.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3643153309/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://swampprince.bandcamp.com/album/s-t-2">s/t by swamp prince</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=old><span class=artist-title><a href="https://tohc83.bandcamp.com/album/old-s-t" class="" target=_blank>OLD</a></span><span class=media-title><em>OLD</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://tohc83.bandcamp.com/album/old-s-t" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://tohc83.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>TOHC83</a> is a Bandcamp presence tied to Brian Taylor of the Toronto record store <a href="https://www.rotate.com/" class="" target=_blank>Rotate This</a>, providing a digital home for historic punk artifacts from the city like the <em>T.O.

Zoom in and zoom out but always zooming, always morphing. Evolution of endless thoughts and the language that is indeed creating reality as we know it. These shapes come from the song!!!

In a statement, the artist revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I was writing about being afraid of moving into the future but also getting excited by it... I knew that I had to change my life and follow my heart in order to evolve and be happy. I think I leaned on nature to do that. Staring at the sun go down, watching birds just float. Nature seems to move without regret or worry. I wanted to write about leaning on my intuition and charging forward into the future with what felt right. I was hit with fresh love and fresh air and a new beginning -- it was exciting. I think this song is about the concept of having a personal renaissance. Looking inward and finding that consistency for yourself even if it means letting go sometimes. Happiness is on the other side.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song arrived alongside a video directed and animated by <a href="http://www.rosaliehmaheux.com/" class="" target=_blank>Rosalie H. Maheux</a>. The track features Zac Rae on synth, prolific producer John Congleton wearing multiple instrumental hats, and a skittering percussion track from Beck and R.E.M. session drummer Joey Waronker.

James got into a deep groove with how we were living immediately. He would knock on my door every morning and wake me up and play me ideas. He&#39;s big on working every single day, and he really helped take the relaxed creative schedule we&#39;d all been on and turnEd it into more of a productive daily routine. &#39;Good Time&#39; was the first songs we created when he pulled up. It&#39;s obviously a bit of a Tom Petty/Jeff Lynne cosplay/worship track, and I&#39;m totally ok with that&quot;.</p></blockquote><p><em>GUV III</em> arrives on March 11 through <a href="http://www.runforcoverrecords.com" class="" target=_blank>Run For Cover</a> and <a href="https://www.handdrawndracula.com" class="" target=_blank>Hand Drawn Dracula</a>, to be followed by <em>GUV IV</em> later in the year.

The night I wrote it, I was in a mad rush against my own urge to self-censor - the lyrics bare no mystery or even much poetry. More than that, they&#39;re honest in a way that STILL makes me uncomfortable.

On the new track, frontman Rishi Dhir commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I built this story line about a hermit named M. Lonely who is very content in his solitary world until a world event happens that causes everyone else to stay home as well... sound familiar? He sees this as a mockery of him and his choices, deciding instead to build a rocket ship to the moon to be left alone... [M. Lonely] ultimately realizes he was happier back on imperfect Earth with all of its imperfect people.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Directors Daniel Ross and Vincent Gauthier treat the song to a suitably psychedelic video. The new record features Dhir on vocals, bass, sitar, synths, guitar, and percussion, with Miles Dupire-Gagnon drumming, guitar and keys from Jason Kent, and Robbie MacArthur on guitar.</p><p>Elephant Stone last released the <em>Hollow</em> LP in 2020.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuciDbdeu1k" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=jason_kent><span class=artist-title><a href="https://jasonkentmusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Jason Kent</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Something More&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview at <a href="https://youtu.be/tyM1CHRqiEM" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Speaking of Jason Kent, the Montreal musician has a new single of his own titled &quot;Something More.&quot; It&#39;s due on <em>Soft Commotion</em>, an LP arriving March 31 from <a href="https://eoprecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Elephants On Parade</a>.

The artist commented in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;At the heart of my new single, &quot;Something More,&quot; is the sentiment that we are currently living in an age where most things are a commodity, and thus we&#39;ll never be completely satisfied. It&#39;s a shrewd nod to the current state of affairs with some rhymes and a backbeat you can sway to... Neil Young said every guitar gives you at least a few songs. I wrote this song the day I purchased my &#39;new&#39; 1968 acoustic guitar.

I hope you like it. Jonny Lovell put down the lead guitar and Kevin Klemp came up with the primary melody years ago. It&#39;s rattled in my brain ever since and only through Covid did I feel ready to work on my finger picking (which is far from good) and write this. I hope Jonny, Kevin and I can work on a fuller-band-full-band version soon, but it&#39;s an important song to me in a form I never expected I&#39;d either do or be able to pull off. It&#39;s supposed to be melancholic, but build into whatever makes you feel light. Whatever helps you see past that melancholy. I hope you enjoy it.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Worst Days Down earlier revealed that a new record titled <em>It All Exists At Once</em> is planned for the near future.

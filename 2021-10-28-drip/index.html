The group shared the news alongside a compellingly dispassionate new single. &quot;Drip&quot; arrives as our second preview of the new record, following &quot;Ice Cream Cone&quot; from back in February. Now I&#39;m not one for lyric videos, but there&#39;s something curiously engrossing about the one showcasing &quot;Drip.&quot; That I seem to connect with the dead button eyes of a puppet turtle is somewhat concerning, but it&#39;s been a rainy week, and I must surely need more sun.</p><p>The new album follows No Frills&#39; 2018 debut, the five-track digital EP <em>Nice To Meet You</em>. That record saw Daniel Busheikin (of Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://grounders.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Grounders</a>) establish the band&#39;s relaxingly downtrodden outlook, backed by his fellow Grounder Kelvin Grove, Jon Pappo (of <a href="https://hoodedfang.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hooded Fang</a> and <a href="https://whimm.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>WHIMM</a>), and Matt &#39;Bucky&#39; Buckberrough (who&#39;s played with <a href="https://www.twistofficial.com/" class="" target=_blank>Twist</a> and <a href="https://bedss.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Beds</a>).</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOYsIFMA10I" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=dysruptive><span class=artist-title><a href="https://dysruptive.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Dysruptive</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Pils Sessions</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://pilssessions.bandcamp.com/album/dysruptive-session-05-9-21" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Last month the gritty Quebec City punk quartet <a href="https://dysruptive.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Dysruptive</a> tracked a five-song set as part of the <a href="https://pilssessions.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Pils Sessions</a>.

I really appreciate that their music walks that line between dancefloor abandon and a sense of political urgency. I know they chose this track to remix because it felt like an unlikely choice and that is why they are interesting and innovative artists! Chris brought something so special to this remix by further interpreting the lyrical content. I felt particularly honoured by that.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Peleda&#39;s Tobias Rochman further delved into the instrumentation, revealing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We recorded during lockdown in an apartment we were sharing at the time using the remix as an opportunity to experiment with different tempos, vocal registers, and rhythmic ideas to play against expectation and test different production techniques. We purposely tried to keep it as empty as possible, keeping the focus on the original vocal which we applied heavy saturation to make it sound rougher and &#39;burnt.&#39; The main gurgling bass is based on the &#39;West Coast Style&#39; synthesis of Don Buchla, the vocal technique was inspired by Ying Yang Twins&#39; &#39;Whisper Song&#39; and the spooky string sound was made by a Solina string machine popularized by Joy Division in their song &#39;Love Will Tear Us Apart.&#39; We purposely used stock Ableton drum sounds to make it feel like anyone could have produced it, to emphasize that limitations can breed creativity and that it&#39;s not always what you have but how you use it that&#39;s important.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The <em>Real Time Remixed</em> collection arrives digitally on November 5.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=710566649/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://newchance.bandcamp.com/album/real-time-remixed">Real Time Remixed by New Chance</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=ghostkeeper><span class=artist-title><a href="https://ghostkeeper.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ghostkeeper</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Grassy Plains&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/0TxbAo259s8" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Calgary indie rock troop <a href="https://ghostkeeper.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ghostkeeper</a> recently unveiled their first new single since 2017. The propulsive &quot;Grassy Plains&quot; carves a unique niche, spinning out of 70s psychedelia with an Indigenous perspective that never feels too precious about its retro influences. The band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Our new single, &#39;Grassy Plains,&#39; charts a fantasy based on a post-apocalyptic scenario where the protagonist&#39;s man has gone off to fight as a revolutionary soldier. Driven to seek the help of the minegishi (sacred little people), she gathers medicine and words to bring her love home. We sought to capture the story of lovers in a dystopian time who lament the distance between them as they struggle to find each other in one realm or another.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This album again finds Ghostkeeper&#39;s core duo of Shane Ghostkeeper and Sarah Houle backed by multi-instrumentalist Ryan Bourne and drummer Eric Hamelin. Founded in the Metis settlement of Paddle Prairie, Alberta, the band&#39;s following up their 2017 LP <em>Sheer Blouse Buffalo Knocks</em> with a new record soon on <a href="https://www.victorypool.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Victory Pool</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TxbAo259s8" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=gulfer><span class=artist-title><a href="https://gulfer.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Gulfer</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;End of the World&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://gulfer.bandcamp.com/track/end-of-the-world" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Montreal emo-revivalists <a href="https://gulfer.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Gulfer</a> has another mathy new single available, with &quot;End of the World&quot; following August&#39;s one-off &quot;Neighbours.&quot; A press release sings the melodic tunes&#39; praises:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Although &#39;End of the World&#39; isn&#39;t Gulfer&#39;s first pandemic song, it&#39;s their first that explores our collective adaptations to new realities. Over intricate call and response guitars that seem to fold in on themselves, Vincent Ford sings of themes parallel to the end of the world: selective memory holes; playing with fire without a care for consequence; and finding your own new ways to cope and just get through the day. End times be damned, &#39;End of the World&#39; is decidedly more melodic than punk, with hooks that demonstrate the band&#39;s ability to write songs on any part of the experimental rock spectrum. Its keenly constructed rhythms keep Gulfer&#39;s compositions unpredictable and inventive, perhaps a figurative mirror in which the band can optimistically see a way out of the impending end of the world.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Gulfer released a self-titled full-length last October through <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain</a> and <a href="https://www.topshelfrecords.com" class="" target=_blank>Topshelf</a>, chasing it earlier this year with a split EP paired with Marquette, MI&#39;s <a href="https://charmermusic.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Charmer</a>.

The track tackles guitarist/vocalist Chrisy Hurn&#39;s struggles with bulimia and related body issues. She comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Eating disorders are - for lack of a better term - a mindfuck. Unfortunately, many aspects of pop culture confirm elements of EDs by focusing heavily on weight loss, fat phobia, and unrealistic beauty standards.</p><p>You know when you are swimming on the beach, and there are really really big waves, and one of them might knock you over, and before you can get up another one pounds you down, and you keep getting pounded wave after wave and you can&#39;t get up and you think that you are going to die and you are gasping for air but you keep swallowing water?

In one of the final videos for it now, I wanted to make sure the gap was closed and the cop got what was coming. Trying to make a dream feel real... This is a song about the apocalypse, with lyrics written before this current apocalypse began.

Sending everyone love. Thank you for lending me your ear.</p><p>I wrote this song while living in a new city, trying to process the feelings that came with that.

The band announced a string of fall tour dates alongside a seasonally appropriate video for the <em>Real One</em> track &quot;Lately.&quot; Shot by Sammy J. Lewis and Adam Testa, the clip features vampires skateboarding through the streets of Ottawa. Coffey commented in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We&#39;re back on the road and we wanted to make it SPOOKY. I kinda felt a little bit like a vampire for the past year... not going out a lot, rarely seeing the light of day. We feel really lucky to be able to play some shows again (as long as things remain safe). One of the most SPECIAL things about this song is it features our great friend Siânteuse singing. A lot of us used to be in a band called <a href="https://sphinxs.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Sphinxs</a> with her and she&#39;s an absolute vocal gymnast. We feel so lucky to have her featuring on the record. She came into the sessions and cracked off all the tracks in a few takes, it really blew us away.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The Iron Lungs kick off their fall run in Hamilton on November 9. <em>Real One</em> arrived in February through <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a>, three long years after the Thin Lizzy-channeling group&#39;s accomplished self-titled LP.

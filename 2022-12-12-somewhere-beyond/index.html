I&#39;m actually rather enamoured with the narrative of a creative shift, as there are often breadcrumb trails obvious only in hindsight. If a compelling story arc&#39;s hidden among isolated songs and past diversions, connecting those dots is immensely satisfying. Honestly, you don&#39;t even need to be right about it. Such is the case with the sardonic Toronto garage punks of <a href="https://teenanger.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Teenanger</a>, and their newly debuted second life as the dub-heavy art-rock act <a href="https://uhhuhband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Uh Huh</a>.</p><p>On 2017&#39;s confusingly-named <em>Teenager</em> LP, the quartet took their foot off the gas, swapping some of their earlier punk grit for synth-supported new wave flourishes. Those changes came with an increasingly wry sense of urban exhaustion and weed-fueled cynicism. 2020&#39;s <em>Good Time</em> kept pace, contrasting the band&#39;s early snap against some delightfully weird yet increasingly groovy instrumentals. Like everything that year, the album fell into a COVID fog without much opportunity for live support. The group shared a pair of one-offs from isolation: &quot;Good, You?&quot; and &quot;Blinds Drawn&quot; - the latter I&#39;ll go to bat for as the high watermark of their catalogue. &quot;Blinds&quot; pushed the six-minute mark, strutting along at a blissed-out pace like the club remix of some long-lost post-punk 12-inch.</p><p>That stylistic drift unsurprisingly paralleled the increasingly ambitious output of the group&#39;s <a href="https://www.telephoneexplosion.com/" class="" target=_blank>Telephone Explosion</a> label - home to the lush orchestrations of Tony Price and Scott Hardware, the robot funk of Lee Paradise, and the sprawling psych-jazz of the Badge Époque Ensemble.</p><p>Given all that history, Uh Huh feels like a natural progression. The new unit still boasts Teenanger&#39;s entire original lineup of Steve Sidoli, Melissa Bell, Jon Schouten, and Chris Swimming (drums, bass, guitar, and vocals in their past incarnation - now more freely trading up roles). They issued the single &quot;Somewhere Beyond&quot; as their first output under the new name, firmly planting a flag that their dub digressions were anything but. The band notes:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The slinking, fractured grooves of &#39;Somewhere Beyond&#39; call to mind the deranged minimal dub-wave of Naffi or an imagined world where the splattered funk of Maximum Joy were a production of Wackies&#39; Brooklyn studio in the early 1980s. Elastic basslines and serpentine guitar phrases throb and glide, cutting through the dubwise sonic murk like a hand moving through an opaque cloud of reefer smoke.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>I&#39;m not cool enough to get those references, but I&#39;m entirely on board with wherever this is going. The quartet recorded at Studio Z in Toronto with Sidoli and Schouten engineering. Dave Plowman, fresh from working the latest Badge Époque epic, mixed the track. You can pick it up now at Bandcamp or wherever you stream.</p><p>When Teenanger issued what&#39;s now their final track, I commented that I wouldn&#39;t complain if they delivered &quot;a full record of burnt-out, neon-washed bummer jams.&quot; It sounds like I may get my wish. Keep an eye on 2023 for the first Uh Huh LP.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2862928324/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://uhhuhband.bandcamp.com/track/somewhere-beyond">Somewhere Beyond by Uh Huh</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=shirley_the_pyramids><span class=artist-title><a href="https://surelyicomequickly.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Shirley &amp; The Pyramids</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Maid of Time</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch &quot;Infinity Blues&quot; on <a href="https://youtu.be/EIAWAenGaL4" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://surelyicomequickly.bandcamp.com/album/maid-of-time" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Saskatoon&#39;s atmospheric indie heroes <a href="https://surelyicomequickly.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Shirley &amp; The Pyramids</a> recently announced <em>Maid of Time</em>, a new nine-song full-length due January 13. The set collects material written and recorded since the world went awry, showcasing the band&#39;s knack for crafting evocative soundscapes from drone and shoegaze elements. It lands in Europe through Dublin&#39;s <a href="https://fuzzedupastromoonrecords.bandcamp.com/album/forever-whatever" class="" target=_blank>Fuzzed Up &amp; Astromoon Records</a> and in Canada on <a href="https://greyrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Grey Records</a>. The group commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;During the pandemic, we wrote and recorded over 20 songs of varying genres and tempos, not really having a specific direction. Over time, a kind of narrative started to form and make sense, the depressive fog started to clear, and things started coming together again. This is the first finished batch of those tunes, and we sincerely hope you like them.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Project lead Aron Zacharias co-produced the new record, the band&#39;s third, with Duncan Pickard. While you wait for the LP to drop, you can now preview the album audio in full at Bandcamp or check out a video for the lead single, &quot;Infinity Blues,&quot; on YouTube.</p><p>The album follows up on the group&#39;s September singles, &quot;Forever Whatever&quot; and &quot;Chinese Pyramids.&quot; This period of activity follows up on the band&#39;s 2019 EP <em>A New American Classic</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=611711150/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://surelyicomequickly.bandcamp.com/album/maid-of-time">Maid of Time by Shirley &amp; The Pyramids</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=butcher_s_laugh><span class=artist-title><a href="https://slow-death-records.bandcamp.com/album/butchers-laugh-demo-2022" class="" target=_blank>Butcher's Laugh</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Demo 2022</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://slow-death-records.bandcamp.com/album/butchers-laugh-demo-2022" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Clayton Keithley of the Vancouver punk act <a href="https://brainbag.bandcamp.com/album/demo" class="" target=_blank>Brain Bag</a> recently resurfaced in <a href="https://slow-death-records.bandcamp.com/album/butchers-laugh-demo-2022" class="" target=_blank>Butcher&#39;s Laugh</a>, a new hardcore project making its debut on <a href="https://slow-death-records.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Slow Death Records</a>. The BC punk label recently issued the band&#39;s 2022 demos on cassette, commenting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Pinpointing the inspiration was a little tricky on this one cause it encompasses so much that backs up why hardcore rules. Defective and botched sounding, never too tight never too loose, just annoyed, bored and pissed music made in a kitchen/basement/bedroom/shed wherever. It checks all the boxes, and you&#39;d expect no less from Joey Shithead&#39;s son. I can&#39;t give it enough praise, so I&#39;ll shut up and let it hit you like it hit me.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As the principal behind Brain Bag, Clayton put out a separate batch of demos in April of this year, also recently collected <a href="https://slow-death-records.bandcamp.com/album/brain-bag-demo" class="" target=_blank>on tape</a> by Slow Death.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=161954632/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://slow-death-records.bandcamp.com/album/butchers-laugh-demo-2022">BUTCHER'S LAUGH - Demo 2022 by Butcher's Laugh</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=sweet_dave><span class=artist-title><a href="https://sweetdave.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sweet Dave</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Chains&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://sweetdave.bandcamp.com/track/chains" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://teeveefreakzz.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>TV Freaks</a> frontman David O&#39;Connor recently shared &quot;Chains,&quot; the first single from a new batch of home-recorded solo material under the guise of <a href="https://sweetdave.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sweet Dave</a>. The artist commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In the last &#39;lockdown&#39; I decided I would bring a Tascam 4 track cassette recorder and a limited bunch of instruments up to our dining room table and record a batch of very simple, un-laboured-over songs. I finished them, but got sidetracked with life and they never saw the light of day. I didn&#39;t labour over the mixing of these- they are as they are on the tape. Raw and simple.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Like Dave&#39;s past solo work, the track accentuates the goth potential of his vocals, a quality that&#39;s often lost among the Freaks&#39; garage-punk racket. Look for more recordings from those dining room sessions in the coming weeks (&quot;Big Hat No Cattle&quot;/&quot;Golden Age&quot; just dropped at press-time).</p><p>This material follows Sweet Dave&#39;s 2021 full-length, <em>Now More Than Ever</em>, and a busy slate of side-projects.

In a press release, they comment:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We wrote this song with a simple in-the-box beat, pressed play on Sam&#39;s looper. Des decided to freestyle vocal to remove her from her overthinking and allowed the channel to be open. Sometimes on three, sometimes on four, but for whatever reason, there was conviction behind the vocal entries. No guitar was decided early on, straying from original form. &#39;In The Water&#39; is Kali Horse&#39;s foray into our personal unknown. A mixture of the dripping of a faucet digitally tuned to its unusual key and beats inspired an exploration of how analog recording and digital music coexist.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This track, in particular, features contributions from Kyle McDonnell on drums and backing vocals, Cassandra Ellen on the tongue drum and singing bowls, Hannah Bussiere-Kim on harp and violin, and Dylan Lee Gamble of <a href="http://hotgarbagemusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Hot Garbage</a> on double bass. <a href="https://mrjoy.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mr. Joy</a>&#39;s Asher Gould-Murtagh mixed the song, with Kristian Montano mastering.

That set, boasting 14 tracks, lands on January 27.</p><p>On Instagram, Caldwell revealed the grim origins of the track, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I wrote it after a family member died by suicide and all of us tried to piece together how something so tragic could have happened so suddenly.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song landed alongside an animated lyric video by Graham and Lukas Avoledo. You can now preview both &quot;Said Something&quot; and the album cut &quot;Your Flame&quot; at Bandcamp.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpCDdpYs2tI" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=ivan_rivers><span class=artist-title><a href="https://ivanrivers.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ivan Rivers</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Poppy&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://ivanrivers.bandcamp.com/track/poppy" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Ivan Raczycki&#39;s Guelph-based folk act <a href="https://ivanrivers.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ivan Rivers</a> often trades in the absurd, but their heartfelt new single &quot;Poppy&quot; is nothing but sincere.

Over 10 years ago I recorded an album with Jim and Jeff in a cottage on a mountain. The concept was simple. Each of us would write a few songs to bring along. We&#39;d collaborate and record them. The catch was the songs had to be written on a tenor guitar. That set off a weird obsession (for all of us I think), about all things tenor... guitars. Like all obsessions, maybe that faded a bit, and the songs were archived for posterity. It took us a while, but we decided to let a few of them out.

Look for news on the band&#39;s sophomore LP soon.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KmMvQtukfo" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2022-12-30-dog-walker/" rel=next title="Next article: Dog Walker"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Dog Walker</div> <div class=pagination-date>December 30, 2022</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2022-11-28-time-to-get-loose/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Time to Get Loose"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Time to Get Loose</div> <div class=pagination-date>November 28, 2022</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

That&#39;s the word we used to refer to the few weeks straddling New Years, back in the early days of Punknews.org. It always seemed that the incoming stream of music news narrowed to a trickle during this time, with few bands making any announcement of note. The release calendar was a wasteland. The big summer tours and festivals were still months out from confirmation. This was the season of collective reminiscence, rankings, and retrospectives. It was hibernation for a daily news site.</p><p>The one area of activity during this time was list writing, with which I&#39;ve never been entirely comfortable. t&#39;s a strange, masturbatory exercise that forces one to quantify art and do it in a way that makes you look good. You measure the records you engaged with against each other, which implies that your appreciation of those albums all comes from a similar place. It assumes there&#39;s a common denominator. It suggests an academic, rather than an emotional connection to music, and I just don&#39;t have that. I&#39;m pretty simple. The feedback I get from readers, though, never bares out these anxieties. People find lists useful, particularly people with lives outside our bubble.</p><p>As such, here are my <a href="https://www.punknews.org/review/15447/best-of-2017-adam-whites-picks" class="" target=_blank>favourite records from 2017</a>. My list even includes an American band, which I felt was a very progressive choice.</p><p>Now reality has a way of calling me on my bullshit. It turns out that my number one and two picks released entirely new albums over Some Party&#39;s holiday break. That&#39;s a break I took on faith that the doldrums would hold. So much for that.</p><p>We were aware that Halifax punk band the <a href="https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Booji Boys</a> were planning to release their second LP on Christmas. That&#39;s precisely what happened. UK label <a href="http://www.drunkensailorrecords.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>Drunken Sailor Records</a> released the five-member band&#39;s <em>Weekend Rocker</em> LP as expected. The 12 song set was recorded by <a href="https://twitter.com/mumfordluke" class="" target=_blank>Luke Mumford</a> over the summer, and finds the Booji Boys continuing the sound they established earlier in the year. This is a group made up of hardcore vets performing hooky, lo-fi power-pop at breakneck speed. What more could you want?</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1019722367/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/album/weekend-rocker-lp">Weekend Rocker LP by Booji Boys</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/album/weekend-rocker-lp" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Booji Boys - <em>Weekend Rocker</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Then there&#39;s Welland, Ontario&#39;s <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a>. Danny had already announced an ingenious winter tour: he&#39;d head out west to Vancouver with his band the Jazz Police while performing music from his solo catalogue, then change guises in BC and head back to Toronto playing as the punk group <a href="http://ancientshapes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ancient Shapes</a>. Ancient Shapes even released a <a href="http://ancientshapes.bandcamp.com/album/rats-forever" class="" target=_blank>charity EP</a> in mid-December to get back on everyone&#39;s radar.</p><p>That wasn&#39;t enough though. Not one to be outdone when it comes to aggressively counter-programming the norms of the music industry, Daniel Romano released two (2) new albums this past week. <em><a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com/album/nerveless" class="" target=_blank>NERVELESS</a></em> and <em><a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com/album/human-touch" class="" target=_blank>HUMAN TOUCH</a></em> feature 10 new songs apiece. That they sound sparser than the lushly arranged <em>Modern Pressure</em> suggests these were home recordings, but they&#39;re hardly throwaways. Dan&#39;s commented that he&#39;s not planning on releasing either record in a physical medium, and futhermore he&#39;s planning to pull both offline at the conclusion of his West Coast tour.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2699164792/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://danielromano.bandcamp.com/album/nerveless">NERVELESS by Daniel Romano</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com/album/nerveless" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Daniel Romano: <em>NERVELESS</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3573456479/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://danielromano.bandcamp.com/album/human-touch">HUMAN TOUCH by Daniel Romano</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com/album/human-touch" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Daniel Romano: <em>HUMAN TOUCH</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>The release schedules both acts have adopted here are abnormal, and there are mostly rational business reasons why that is. Labels don&#39;t release records on Christmas day when the audience is distracted. Bands avoid releasing material too close to the end of the year-end recap cycle because they want consideration. Barely anyone releases two full-lengths in a calendar year, and never two records at once, for a whole host of marketing reasons. Let&#39;s not even address the ticking time-bomb shelf life. As a fan, though, this is all quite exciting, and dare I say pretty punk. The industry works in predictable cycles, but as an artist, you need not bend to conventional wisdom. I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not my job to try and promote these things.</p><h2 class=generic>Presenting Weaves in Niagara</span></h2><p>Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://www.weavesband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Weaves</a> have announced a March mini-tour in support of their fantastic recent <a href="http://buzzrecords.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Buzz Records</a> full-length <em>Wide Open</em>. From the 2nd through the 5th the band will play the Guelph Concert Centre, Ottawa&#39;s House of Targ, Montreal&#39;s Bar Le Ritz, and then the Warehouse in St, Catharines. That last show&#39;s an important one, and not just because it&#39;s local to me. The March 5th Weaves show at the <a href="http://warehouseniagara.com/" class="" target=_blank>Warehouse Concert Hall</a> will be a co-presentation of <a href="http://warehouseniagara.com/indoorshoes/" class="" target=_blank>IndoorShoes</a> and Some Party.

The duo&#39;s been heralding their debut for a year now, and with the release finally pending we&#39;re starting to hear a lot more from it. The band&#39;s self-titled record will feature eleven songs, four of which you can currently preview at Bandcamp. Jimmie also revealed a video which previews the songs &quot;Blue Beard,&quot; &quot;You Know Who,&quot; and &quot;Master of Emotion&quot; at YouTube. Check it out below. The Heat Death oscillates between midtempo pop-rock (Jimmie&#39;s leads) and a lush slow-burn where Contreras takes charge, both vocalists maintaining their distinctive traits. It&#39;s all washed in a spacey reverb that gives this project its own character. The Heat Death&#39;s self-titled full length arrives on February 14.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 gesture=media allow=encrypted-media allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Xg0yEy3lpA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xg0yEy3lpA" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: The Heat Death - Three Singles @ YouTube</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/chillerband/" class="" target=_blank>Chiller</a> has emerged as the successor to the Moncton&#39;s punk group <a href="https://feraltrash.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Feral Trash</a>.

That band released a single for the song &quot;Seek Your Pleasure,&quot; backed with &quot;Another Day Above Ground.&quot; The A-side&#39;s authentically goth, with the tempo picking up and showing a punk backbeat on the flip side.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1847139613/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://blowbloodrecords.bandcamp.com/album/demo-cs-2">"Demo" CS by No Blues</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://blowbloodrecords.bandcamp.com/album/demo-cs-2" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: No Blues - &quot;Demo&quot; CS @ Bandcamp</a></p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3447172171/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://blackbaron.bandcamp.com/album/seek-your-pleasure-b-w-another-day-above-ground">Seek Your Pleasure b/w Another Day Above Ground by Black Baron</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://blackbaron.bandcamp.com/album/seek-your-pleasure-b-w-another-day-above-ground" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Black Baron - &quot;Seek Your Pleasure&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>The new year came with a handful of new music from the Vancouver scene. <a href="https://chrisariffic.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chris-a-riffic</a>, the quirky solo project of Chris Alscher (<a href="https://theyshoothorsesdontthey.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>They Shoot Horses Don&#39;t They?</a>, <a href="http://collapsingopposites.com/" class="" target=_blank>Collapsing Opposites</a>, Bible Belts, CiTR&#39;s <a href="http://www.citr.ca/radio/parts-unknown/" class="" target=_blank>Parts Unknown</a>), is back with a new full length on March 20 titled <em>Post-Season</em>.

If my daughter&#39;s binge-watching some cartoon on Netflix and stumbles upon a Christmas special at any other time of year, it&#39;s absolutely grating. I hate few things more.</p><p>That said, if you haven&#39;t seen <a href="http://www.strombo.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Strombo Show</a>&#39;s <a href="http://strombo.com/radio/episode/a-very-strombo-special-holiday-special/" class="" target=_blank>Very Strombo Holiday Special</a> you&#39;ll find more than a few familiar faces taking part.

If you ever wanted to see <a href="https://twist.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Twist</a> cover Wham! this is where it&#39;s at. The show also includes performances from <a href="https://lidopimienta.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lido Pimienta</a>, <a href="https://www.partnerband.com" class="" target=_blank>Partner</a>, and a dozen others.

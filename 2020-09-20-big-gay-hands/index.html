The long-awaited studio version of the track doesn&#39;t disappoint, lyrically flipping a hard-rock trope on its head while at the same time paying unabashed homage to the guitar heroism of its classic rock forebearers. The band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Big Gay Hands&#39; has been a live favourite for 3 years now, and we&#39;re so excited to release it on our upcoming album, <em>Never Give Up</em>. We wrote &#39;Big Gay Hands&#39; after listening to a lot of AC/DC and other hard rock acts singing about women&#39;s bodies and sexualizing them. We didn&#39;t think there was enough songs out there (or even A song?) about women&#39;s big gay hands. So we fixed that.</p><p>This song is about a wild night on the town filled with queer desire. It is an important song to us because it expresses a feeling we know is shared by many. There are a lot of songs out there about women&#39;s bodies but this is the only song we know about big gay hands. This song is dedicated to the hotties and to those who love them.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Partner worked with <a href="https://bonniedoon.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bonnie Doon</a>&#39;s Lesley Marshall on the accompanying video (which is absolutely adorable, by the way).</p><p>The 10-song <em>Never Give Up</em> arrives from <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> on November 20, following up 2017&#39;s <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> and 2019&#39;s <em>Saturday the 14th</em> EP. This record finds vocalist/guitarist Jos√©e Caron and vocalist/bassist Lucy Niles backed by drummer Simone TB (Darlene Shrugg, Fake Palms). Partner recorded this material in July of 2019 at Palace Sounds, with Steve Chahley (Ice Cream, US Girls) engineering.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hxWLlmQYVY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/3hxWLlmQYVY" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Partner - &quot;Big Gay Hands&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto punk trio <a href="https://theobgms.com/" class="" target=_blank>The OBGMs</a> have a frantic new video online featuring &quot;Outsah,&quot; the album-opening cut from their upcoming full-length <em>The Ends</em>.

I wanted to tell a story in a cinematic continuous shot and really make a statement. This song, and this video, speak to what we are willing to do. We are going to run up in your house, give us what we want.</p><p>This is one of those songs where we&#39;re doing stuff other people aren&#39;t doing. We threw bongos on the motherfucker. That song is a statement and that statement is, &#39;We&#39;re not afraid of you, and we&#39;de willing to confront you. Come see me if you have a problem with it. We&#39;re already outside.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>The Ends</em> arrives on October 30 from <a href="https://weareblackbox.com/" class="" target=_blank>Black Box</a>. These days the OBGMs play as a trio comprised of McFarlane, bassist Joseph Brosnan, and drummer Colanthony Humphrey.

Oppenheim, who had been active in the New York No Wave scene (rather astonishingly) at the age of 10, tracked her initial demo of this song with Eugenie Diserio and Steven Alexander of The Dance. This period followed the break-up of The Chandra Dimension, but just before Oppenheim left the recorded music world to pursue her education. The vocalist commented on the track&#39;s history in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I don&#39;t have a clear memory of what inspired it. My guess is that it was meant to be a message to people who felt they were on the periphery. I was giving advice based on my experiences at middle school of feeling excluded and rejected.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Chandra&#39;s band features several Toronto-based musicians with whom readers of this newsletter should be well acquainted. Among the group, you&#39;ll find Victoria Cheong (<a href="https://www.newchance.biz/" class="" target=_blank>New Chance</a>) and <a href="https://bilesister.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Bile Sister</a>&#39;s Julie Reich on vocals, Kristina Koski on keyboards, <a href="https://teenanger.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Teenanger</a>&#39;s Jon Schouten on guitar, Nyles Miszczyk on bass, and Jesse Locke of <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a> on drums.</p><p>The track&#39;s digital release includes a dub remix of the single by Saturday Looks Good To Me legend Fred Thomas.

Without the accompaniment of other musicians, Castle&#39;s crafted a far more vulnerable and intimate sound this time out. That sense of space allowed Castle the room to incorporate field recordings of insects, waterfowl, and the waves on Lake Erie into the mix (physical versions of the release include expanded segments of these as ambient interludes).</p><p>Castle worked with longtime co-producer Jeff McMurrich on the album.

Even in the broken place where I have only questions and fists, there is another, more powerful place, where I have hope and courage. Thrust upon many mothers is the assumption we can find hope at all costs, in any condition, even when great injustices have occurred. The world looks to mothers as a symbol of hope and strength. This song is by them, for them. And for all the people, young or old, who might need it.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbGgBj2ABnI" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/rbGgBj2ABnI" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Jennifer Castle - &quot;Justice&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto punk favourites <a href="http://www.puptheband.com/" class="" target=_blank>PUP</a> have collected some of their isolation-era work as a new EP, a piece that carries the rather brash (but not at all inaccurate) title of <em>This Place Sucks Ass</em>.

Literally any city, whether it was Lethbridge, AB, or New York City, we&#39;d be like, &#39;This place sucks ass.&#39; We have so much negativity, and sometimes it becomes so extreme and ridiculous that we start to find it funny. But at this moment in time, it feels so fucking real. Wherever you are, it sucks ass right now. So, wherever you live, whatever your circumstances, this is an EP about the place you&#39;re from, and the place you&#39;re at now.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The EP arrives in Canada on the band&#39;s <a href="http://www.littledipperart.com/" class="" target=_blank>Little Dipper</a> imprint, with Rise Records issuing the US version.

You can preview the record now through the single &quot;Message to the Past.&quot;</p><p>The label elaborated on Lee&#39;s songwriting process, highlighting how the live incarnation of the project helped shape these new tunes:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Beginning with a bedrock of programmed drums ‚Äî the same kick, snare, and cymbal samples he first used 10 years ago ‚Äî Lee attempted to channel the hard-hitting sound quality of old hip-hop. From here, he stacked up layers of eerie vocals, chaotic extraterrestrial synths, and the massive bass lines that provide Lee Paradise&#39;s signature sonic element. This sound continued to develop through live performances with a trio version of the band, as drummer Jonathan Pappo&#39;s nimble rhythms and Michael Butler&#39;s Yamaha CS-5 fleshed out the songs even further. It was this process that forced Lee to write lyrics, shaping his musical sketches into contained forms.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Dan Lee plays in the Toronto art-rock group <a href="https://hoodedfang.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hooded Fang</a> as well as the electronic psych-pop group <a href="https://phedre.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ph√®dre</a>.

This week the trio shared the single &quot;Blind Youth Industrial Park,&quot; as showcased in a dystopian video by director Dylan Pharazyn. Pharazyn commented on the New Zealand-shot short and its dark sci-fi undertones:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I started thinking of the feeling of war or samurai films, beautiful but dark and violent... but then I had this idea to work up a more unique world... I started to think of a more futuristic setting ‚Äî more unusual and dream-like with the story set on a distant planet where there is future technology and some kind of alien magic... like a futuristic fable. I loved the idea of the hero Ayeth on this nomadic walk through an epic landscape... I loved the strength in her and the pairing of her with a wounded companion, something really human and vulnerable‚Ä¶ I wanted that emotive warmth countering the cold military images.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Similar to PUP&#39;s plans, METZ also announced that a live stream performance to coincide with the release. The ticketed event will see the group playing the record in its entirety on October 15, with the trio taking the stage at Toronto&#39;s Opera House. An October 17 performance will also air, targeting audiences overseas. Tickets and details on the streams are online at the band&#39;s <a href="https://dice.fm/artist/metz-jvl4" class="" target=_blank>store</a>.</p><p>Frontman Alex Edkins commented on the importance of the live show and reflected on its glaring absence this album cycle:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Something that is intrinsic to who we are as people has been taken away. We want, so badly, to find that feeling again, to forget the world for a moment, and share a brand new album that we love very much (plus some oldies) with you. To all the people of the world who have come to our shows to dance, sweat, and scream, we hope you can join us once again with this show.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Atlas Vending</em> arrives on October 9 from <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain Records</a> and <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a>.

In the premiere at <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/zoon/zoon-brokenhead-premiere/" class="" target=_blank>Paste Magazine</a>, Zoon principal Daniel Monkman commented on the track&#39;s emotional connection to his family&#39;s experience with Canada&#39;s residential school system:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The song &#39;Brokenhead&#39; was written/composed from a feeling I had when I left the reservation as a young teen. It was the first time I had built a strong relationship with my dad since becoming a young adult. He wanted a better life for me - to get me off the reserve and explore Canada. To do this he helped me buy a truck. My dad had been recently compensated by the Canadian government for being forced to attend residential schools from childhood to early teens. Although his ability to help me came at a great cost and I wouldn&#39;t fully understand until years later, the realization heavily influenced the conception of &#39;Brokenhead.&#39; I remember that very first solo drive away from his place after months of teaching me to drive. He and my uncle followed me a short distance down the highway and then stopped. I could see he and my uncle in the review mirror waving goodbye as distance between us grew further and further away. I felt a kind of triumph and yet a rush of sadness/happiness. When I was recording the guitars, I kept focusing on that feeling.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Monkman worked with director (and all-around Some Party pal) <a href="https://www.immvproductions.com" class="" target=_blank>Justis Krar</a> of IMMV Productions on the video.

We loved it. It was the best song we recorded for our 2016 album <em>Hold/Still</em>, but it didn&#39;t make the cut, probably because we loved it so much and thought we had an even better version of it in us. We subsequently tried to record multiple versions of this song, none of which captured the unhinged energy of this live-off-the-floor performance. Discovering this lost jam and its power felt like a reminder to keep in the moment and to trust ourselves - you just have to keep moving forward.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The record includes guest appearances from <a href="http://www.blackmountainarmy.com/" class="" target=_blank>Black Mountain</a>&#39;s Amber Webber and Montreal artist <a href="https://www.jerusaleminmyheart.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jerusalem In My Heart</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pY56vaNYCVE" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pY56vaNYCVE" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Suuns - &quot;Pray&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Hamilton skid-troubadour <a href="http://www.bajohnston.ca/" class="" target=_blank>B.A. Johnston</a> recently shared a home recording of a new song dubbed &quot;Don&#39;t Wanna Work for a Living (Wish I was born an Irving).&quot; The tune arrived in the wake of the recent New Brunswick election, which saw former Irving Oil executive Blaine Higgs re-elected with a majority government.

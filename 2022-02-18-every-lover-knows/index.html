Whatever groove I settled into has clearly been shaken, either by the shifting effects of the pandemic or just your typical winter morass. Perhaps it&#39;s a combination of the two. My anxiety levels tend to swing quite dramatically based on how late I am with the newsletter, which surely can&#39;t be healthy given that there&#39;d be no tangible consequence if I just up and vanished. Not that anyone&#39;s complaining, but that you for your patience.</p><p>Wait, why aren&#39;t you complaining?</p><p>Of course, it&#39;s easy to fall prey to fatigue and distraction when the material I&#39;m sifting through feels so hollow. There&#39;s no shortage of new music flowing through, but I&#39;m obviously not the audience for most of it. There are so few regular Canadian music blogs that I felt obliged to give everything vying for my ear a fair shake, but that doesn&#39;t scale. If this isn&#39;t fun, then why am I doing it? Why would anyone?</p><p>These were just a few of the paralyzing thoughts that utterly vanished yesterday morning when I saw the subject line in my inbox: &quot;new release from <a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a>.&quot; Instant focus. Instant purpose. Whatever cloud obscured my motivation to get this edition out the door vanished.</p><p>The ever-esoteric solo artist has a new LP set for an April 29 release through <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>. Discounting a handful of recent collaborations, the 11-song <em>Volcano Volcano</em> lands as the proper follow-up to 2019&#39;s <em>Dark Blue</em>. Judging from the single &quot;Every Lover Knows,&quot; it perhaps finds the artist revisiting the louder full-band approach of his later Baby Eagle records. Lambke recorded in part at Camera Varda, the Welland studio established recently by <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a>. Danny drums on this album, contributing organ and vocals as well. He&#39;s brought along Dave Nardi from The Outfit to play bass and their recent Texan collaborator Carson McHone on backing vocals (both Romano and Nardi performed on <em>Dark Blue</em>, as well). Cons guitarist/keyboardist Will Kidman also appears, lending a solo to the track &quot;Sorrow and Doubt.&quot; With so many of my favourite players involved, every detail of this record is positively energizing.</p><p>The triumphant Crazy Horse vibes of &quot;Every Lover Knows&quot; arrived as a two-song single at Bandcamp, paired with the non-album B-side &quot;Deep Water.&quot; On the former, Steve reveals:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The songs on Volcano Volcano were written as affirmations of a shared world. The world as it is. To affirm the reality and the great mutuality of the world, to experience the world through listening and breathing; to experience connections with different parts of the world, and relationships that feel like identification or understanding or participation or collaboration. And so it was written against the liars and politicians and corporations and police who say that life, your life, can be lived individually, on individually enclosed land, can be raised or punished individually, and outside the reckoning of history. Against the billionaires and their spaceships who imagine environmentally controlled existences on distant planets. As if no storms on Mars! Every Lover Knows is a song of celebration of experience as a teacher. The most profound moments in a life are often experiences of love, of connection, to another, to the world, to a shared moment. It is love that teaches the full scale of what can be experienced and of what can be lost.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>There&#39;s a lovely write-up attached to the <a href="https://stevenlambke.bandcamp.com/album/volcano-volcano" class="" target=_blank>full-length</a> by <a href="https://leannesimpson.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Leanne Betasamosake Simpson</a>. While it curiously references Ed Shereen more than you&#39;d assume, it makes an eloquent case for the appeal of Lambke&#39;s solo work.</p><p>Since the hushed notes of <em>Dark Blue</em>, Lambke&#39;s issued a series of pandemic-era curios. These included the instrumental <em>dub.tape</em> EP - composed for that dreaded grade school terror - the soprano recorder. He sang lead on the hardcore-styled <em>Spider Bite</em> LP, taking part in Romano&#39;s astonishing run of 2020 full-lengths. Last year he issued <em>Former Firsts</em>, the second in a series of collaborative tapes with Colleen Collins and Dave Trenaman of Nova Scotias&#39; now-defunct <a href="https://constructionanddestruction.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Construction &amp; Destruction</a>. This period also saw him pass the baton of <a href="http://www.sappyfest.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sappyfest</a>&#39;s creative directorship to Dawson City Music Fest veteran Andrea Vincent.</p><p>I still remember sitting in my University of Guelph dorm room, headphones on, pondering over Lambke&#39;s scratchy, whispered vocals on that first <a href="http://theconstantines.wordpress.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constantines</a> record. That his work&#39;s been such a rewarding companion in the years since has been an absolute blessing.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1971939305/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://stevenlambke.bandcamp.com/album/every-lover-knows-deep-water">Every Lover Knows / Deep Water by Steven Lambke</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=peanut_butter_sunday><span class=artist-title><a href="https://peanutbuttersundayessir.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Peanut Butter Sunday</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Soleil&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch at <a href="https://youtu.be/LEVg-A3WU1Q" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://peanutbuttersundayessir.bandcamp.com/track/soleil" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://acadianembassy.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Acadian Embassy</a> recently debuted <a href="https://peanutbuttersundayessir.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Peanut Butter Sunday</a>, a loudly Acadian pop-punk band hailing from La Baie Sainte-Marie, Nova Scotia. The quartet&#39;s infectious first single, &quot;Soleil,&quot; landed alongside an irreverent new video.</p><p>The group features guitarist/vocalist <a href="https://michaelsaulnier.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Michael Saulnier</a>, drummer Andre LeBlanc, guitarist Normand Pothier, and bassist Jacques Blinn.

The project has roots in Saulnier&#39;s participation in Stella 2020, an artist development program offered through <a href="https://fecane.ca/" class="" target=_blank>FéCANE</a> (the Fédération culturelle acadienne de la Nouvelle-Écosse).</p><p>Saulnier commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This band is all about having fun. It&#39;s really exciting to write tunes knowing you&#39;re going to scream them in a mic on stage with your friends, and to do it without sacrificing who we are and what we love. It&#39;s just a hell of a good time for us and it&#39;s alright if you don&#39;t understand.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Peanut Butter Sunday has their first Halifax show queued up for March 18 at The Seahorse Tavern with labelmates <a href="https://sluicehfx.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sluice</a> and Denzel Subban.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LEVg-A3WU1Q" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=school_damage><span class=artist-title><a href="https://schooldamage.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>School Damage</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Critical Excess</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://schooldamage.bandcamp.com/album/critical-excess" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>At long last, my old haunt at Punknews premiered <em>Critical Excess</em>, the third full-length from Toronto punks <a href="https://schooldamage.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>School Damage</a>.

The 13-song set lands as the melodic hardcore trio&#39;s first long-player since 2018&#39;s <em>Hello, Cruel World</em>.</p><p>First assembled in 2010, the modern-day School Damage lineup features guitarist/vocalist Brad Manners, bassist/vocalist Jon Cabatan, and drummer Den Den Lee (formerly of Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://boids.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Boids</a> and <a href="https://planetsmashers.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Planet Smashers</a>). Cabatan engineered the record alongside Greg Hounsell of fellow Toronto punks <a href="http://brutalyouth.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Brutal Youth</a>.

The set&#39;s aggressive title track landed alongside a video by director Corduroy Paco. The band hyped the EP with their usual aplomb:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;From the band that stole the &#39;here and now&#39; from the blind claws of regression, Dboy presents four new plays for the pace age. A rapid, sonic test; an unploughed field. Three beads of sweat no cloth can arrest. Self-reflexive songs for self reflexive people -- the boy is the brick, the book, and the steeple.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new songs, recorded at Hamilton&#39;s Deadquarters (the studio of <a href="https://zdeadtiredz.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dead Tired</a> guitarist Marco Bressette), follow <em>New Records In Human Power</em>. That album arrived in early 2020, just before it became apparent what a shitty few years we were all in for.</p><p>Dboy features the gravelly pipes of guitarist/vocalist Matt Sajn (<a href="https://northernprimitive.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Northern Primitive</a>), backed by bassist Tony Ventresca and drummer Ricky Pridmore (both played in the sometimes-Ceremonial ska-punk act <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thesnipsmusic/" class="" target=_blank>The Snips</a>).</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IjjIQIa9xM4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=jenny_berkel><span class=artist-title><a href="https://jennyberkel.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jenny Berkel</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;You Think You&#39;re Like the Rain&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch at <a href="https://youtu.be/xMwNI4MCHiQ" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://jennyberkel.bandcamp.com/album/these-are-the-sounds-left-from-leaving" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>On the subject of musicians in Daniel Romano&#39;s orbit - the singer-songwriter and poet <a href="https://jennyberkel.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jenny Berkel</a> returns this May with <em>These are the Sounds Left From Leaving</em>, a new 10-song full-length and the follow-up to last year&#39;s <em>Pale Moon Kid</em>. You can preview the record now with the slyly propulsive &quot;You Think You&#39;re Like the Rain.&quot; In a press release, Berkel commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I don&#39;t typically write songs that feel a bit hopeful, but I think this track is meant to recognize the multitudes that a person contains: &#39;I know you&#39;re not the rain, though maybe you&#39;re everything.&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The single arrived alongside a video from director Meg Hubley and Phyllis Rising Productions.

The record features contributions from Glentworth, SK folk duo <a href="https://kacyandclayton.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Kacy &amp; Clayton</a> and string arrangements from Colin Nealis (Andy Shauf).

They unveiled the slow-burning tune &quot;The Trees&quot; as their latest preview, following the psych-tinged &quot;Grassy Plains&quot; earlier this year. The band reflected on the aspects of Indigenous spirituality present in the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot; [The Trees is about] escaping this colonial, political climate with its greed that abuses the Earth and its many religions that vie to conquer and chain the soul. It&#39;s about yearning to return to that powerful spot: that piece of land where I have played in wonderment with the Creator as it engaged as Mother Earth and Grandmother Sun; that place in time when spirituality was simple, concise and magical... and I felt safe, inspired, and grateful.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This album again finds Ghostkeeper&#39;s core duo of Shane Ghostkeeper and Sarah Houle backed by multi-instrumentalist <a href="https://ryanbourne.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ryan Bourne</a> (of <a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chad VanGaalen</a>&#39;s Bleach Wipes) and drummer Eric Hamelin.

Black Emperor</a> then this update&#39;s certainly redundant - but in case you missed it: at long last, the band&#39;s officially issued a digital copy of <em>all lights fucked on the hairy amp drooling</em>. This limited-run 1994 demo&#39;s spent years wrapped in rumour, elevated by fans and collectors to become one of the greatest lost legends of Canadian music. The band, a trio at the time, only dubbed 33 copies of the original cassette. While they never denied its existence, they&#39;ve also felt no urgency to shine a spotlight on their nascent form (Godspeed&#39;s first full length, featuring a radically expanded lineup and a refocused sound, arrived years later as 1997&#39;s <em>F♯ A♯ ∞</em>).</p><p>With a bootleg of the audio finally surfacing online earlier this year, Efrim Menuck made it official - posting the set on Bandcamp broken into four tracks collecting 27 short songs. All proceeds from the official sale of the audio are due for <a href="https://www.cjpme.org/" class="" target=_blank>CJPME</a>&#39;s campaign to provide medical oxygen to the Gaza Strip.</p><p>Menuck appeared on <a href="http://vishkhanna.com/" class="" target=_blank>Vish Khanna</a>&#39;s <a href="http://vishkhanna.com/kreative-kontrol/" class="" target=_blank>Kreative Kontrol</a> podcast to discuss the release, commenting (as transcribed by the fine folks at Exclaim):</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This was 30 years ago, and I guess for the last 20 years, I&#39;ve been answering questions about this fucking cassette... Whenever it would come up, I would get sort of agitated. I would notice I would get... a little anxious, and I don&#39;t know why that is. And then, I was listening to it a couple of nights ago and I realize it&#39;s because it was rough times for me then. I think we all have this in our lives, rough times that have never really been resolved. There&#39;s some things you just never get closure on, whether it&#39;s other people&#39;s actions or circumstances, or your own actions. So I think, because of what the gesture was of making this cassette, it resides right on that spot, it presses on that wound, which is, I think, part of the reason why, whenever the thought came up, &#39;Well, maybe we should put this out,&#39; my reaction was always, &#39;No, I don&#39;t want to do that.&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Godspeed last issued <em>G_d&#39;s Pee AT STATE&#39;S END!</em> through <a href="http://cstrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constellation Records</a> in 2021.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1763612294/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://godspeedyoublackemperor.bandcamp.com/album/all-lights-fucked-on-the-hairy-amp-drooling">all lights fucked on the hairy amp drooling by Godspeed You!

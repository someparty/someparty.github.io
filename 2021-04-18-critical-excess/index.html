The new record, the band&#39;s third, is due this summer, slated for a July arrival through the Pennsylvania label <a href="http://momsbasementrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Moms Basement</a> and Italy&#39;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ibuyrecordswebzine/" class="" target=_blank>I Buy Records</a>. The new track arrives in the wake of last November&#39;s whip-fast <em>No Love</em> EP and the late-2019 short set <em>Fuckin&#39; Rights</em>. It&#39;ll be the melodic hardcore trio&#39;s first long-player since 2018&#39;s <em>Hello, Cruel World</em>.</p><p>Vocalist/guitarist <a href="https://bradmanners.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Brad Manners</a> commented on the new work, which again strives for a middle ground between pop-punk hooks and hardcore aggression:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Lyrically, the songs are more personal and darker, which seem fitting in today&#39;s economic and social climate. This album serves as a byproduct of the times as well as personal growth during a social and mental collapse. This is probably the most raw and mature material this band has ever produced in its ten years of existence.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Greg Hounsell of fellow Toronto punks <a href="http://brutalyouth.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Brutal Youth</a> mixed the upcoming record.</p><p>The members of School Damage waited out the pandemic with a few cool side projects. Brad Manners issued the isolation-era <em>Bored to be Alive</em> EP in June, remotely bringing together several guests (including members of <a href="https://the-vapids.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Vapids</a> and Brutal Youth) as <a href="https://bradmanners.bandcamp.com/album/bored-to-be-alive" class="" target=_blank>Brad Manners and his Issues</a> (raising funds for the NAACP along the way). He followed it at Halloween with the soundtrack-bound synth-driven number &quot;<a href="https://bradmanners.bandcamp.com/track/the-next-days-curse" class="" target=_blank>The Next Day&#39;s Curse</a>.&quot; A scathing three-song EP under the name <a href="https://bradmanners.bandcamp.com/album/atomic-wrong" class="" target=_blank>Atomic Wrong</a> arrived this past February.</p><p>School Damage has been kicking around since 2010. The group currently features Manners and bassist/vocalist Jon Cabatan with drummer Dennis Lee (formerly of Montreal&#39;s Boids and The Planet Smashers).</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1256757956/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://schooldamage.bandcamp.com/track/critical-excess">Critical Excess by School Damage</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=slow_down_molasses><span class=artist-title><a href="https://slowdownmolasses.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Slow Down Molasses</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Street Haunting&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/CkBsaCw7VoM" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://slowdownmolasses.bandcamp.com/track/street-haunting" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Saskatoon post-punk outfit <a href="https://slowdownmolasses.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Slow Down Molasses</a> recently returned to action with their first new material in nearly five years. &quot;Street Haunting&quot; delivers a tightly wound evolution of the band&#39;s sound, paying tribute to the rhythmic influence of Gang of Four and Sonic Youth&#39;s tense fuzz along the way. The track arrived just a few weeks ago as the quartet&#39;s first follow-up to their 2016 record, <em>100% Sunshine</em>.</p><p>In a statement guitarist/vocalist Tyson McShane commented on the track, which takes inspiration from the Virginia Woolf essay of the same name:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;...the song ruminates on the casual, but oft-underappreciated beauty of the urban environment and the predictability of a person&#39;s daily tasks... A place sometimes overflowing with creative energy, but where it often necessary to remind oneself of the casual brilliance of one&#39;s peers and the places we typically tend to haunt.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band worked with Halifax-based <a href="https://noyesrecords.limitedrun.com" class="" target=_blank>Noyes Records</a> and Oxford&#39;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/divineschism/" class="" target=_blank>Divine Schism</a> on the release. <a href="http://ytstlabs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Yamantaka // Sonic Titan</a>&#39;s Alaska B mixed the track, with Ryan Morey (Wares, Chad VanGaalen) mastering. The group recorded with engineer Mike LeFebvre at Saskatoon&#39;s Sweat Shoppe (over a year ago - with the pandemic throwing a damper on their intended release plans).</p><p>Slow Down Molasses features Tyson McShane on guitar and vocals, Aaron Scholz on guitar and synth, bass from Chris Morix, and Jordan Kurtz on drums. Scholz also directed a video featuring &quot;Street Haunting,&quot; available now on YouTube.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CkBsaCw7VoM" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=ducks_ltd><span class=artist-title><a href="https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ducks Ltd.</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;As Big As All Outside&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/ZwjnUmqOIQ8" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com/album/get-bleak" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Jangle-pop outfit Ducks Unlimited really seemed to be ramping up in late 2019, garnering a fair bit of attention with their <em>Get Bleak</em> EP and lining up some cool gigs on the scrappy end of Toronto&#39;s indie rock scene. You know how where the story goes from here - catastrophic world-ending something-or-other... lost year... etc.</p><p>It appears the group&#39;s recovered just fine, although not without losing a few syllables. The band&#39;s now known as <a href="https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ducks Ltd.</a>, swerving to avoid any confusion with the hunter-driven wetlands-concerned nonprofit my grandfather seemed quite fond of. They&#39;ve also opted to give <em>Get Bleak</em> a proper re-launch, signing with <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain</a> in Canada and <a href="http://carparkrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Carpark Records</a> elsewhere to issue an expanded version this spring. The set now features seven songs (three more than the first go-around), which you can preview through the new single &quot;As Big As All Outside.&quot; The band commented on the sentiment behind the track in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Over the last several years I don&#39;t think I was alone in the sense of decline that seemed to be hanging over a lot of day-to-day existence, and on my bad days, I can really let that feeling permeate everything. I&#39;m consistently awed by all of the little things that can pull me out of it though. Things as simple as the extended &#39;Canadian Club&#39; mix of the 1991 Sisters of Mercy single &#39;Vision Thing&#39; which gets a mention in the third verse. The original version of &#39;Vision Thing&#39; is good, but for the extended mix they just add on 2 and a half minutes at the end of Andrew Eldritch doing spooky laughs and vamping and it totally fucking rules. Never fails to remind me that in spite of everything the world is capable of being very good and fun sometimes.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Ducks Ltd. features Evan Lewis on lead guitar and Tom Mcgreevy on vocals and rhythm guitar, with a host of collaborators helping out from track to track. Those guests include Laura Hermiston of <a href="https://www.twistofficial.com/" class="" target=_blank>Twist</a>, Mike Searle of <a href="https://grounders.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Grounders</a>, Kurtis Marcoux, and Mike Duffield. String arrangements from <a href="https://goosebump.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Goosebump</a>&#39;s Paul Erlichman factor prominently into several songs, as well.</p><p>The original Ducks Unlimited version of <em>Get Bleak</em> came out in 2019 on the Spanish label <a href="https://bobointegral.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bobo Integral</a>. The redux arrives May 21.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZwjnUmqOIQ8" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=century_egg><span class=artist-title><a href="https://centuryegg.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Century Egg</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Ring a Bell&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://centuryegg.bandcamp.com/track/ring-a-bell" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Ebullient Halifax mandopop rockers <a href="https://centuryegg.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Century Egg</a> recently shared &quot;Ring A Bell,&quot; our second preview of their upcoming <em>Little Piece of Hair</em> EP.

The band detailed the song in the album&#39;s writeup at Bandcamp:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Paid In Pride&#39; describes a trophy wife&#39;s labour, as [Bianca] Palmer holds a steady four-count on the bass drum and an almost disco groove on the hi-hats. It builds into banger territory — cavernous and paranoid, overwhelming, almost violent — dissolving into the elegant acoustic sounds of its origin.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The record finds Schmidt working with a team of improvisational maritime musicians, writing and recording in a Maritime residency in 2017 and 2018. Those players include <a href="https://budi.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nick Dourado</a> (<a href="https://aquakultre.d]bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Aquakultre</a>, and a past member of the above-mentioned Century Egg), <a href="https://specialcostello.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Special Costello</a>&#39;s Jeremy Costello, and <a href="http://vulvaculture.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Vulva Culture</a>&#39;s Bianca Palmer.

Guitarist Justin Cober commented on the propulsive krautrock-inspired instrumental in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Driving, simple, straight forward repetition, built into a psychedelic haze with no apparent meaning.

He commented on the piece:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The members of Autogramm and I all have a relationship to skateboarding. The lyrics of &#39;Mantra&#39; describe a certain relationship to satori, meditation, focus/flow, repetition, mind/no mind, of being in the zone.

A way of training to be prepared for flow when you need to flow.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Guitarist/vocalist Jiffy Marx (Hard Drugs, Blood Meridian) added:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;On our first tour to Mexico we flew in on a red eye flight then partied all night every night for a week. It was super fun but my internal clock never really adjusted - I&#39;d be up until 3 or 4am every night and then waking at 7am, which is when I usually get up at home.

The band&#39;s showcasing &quot;The Weather is Unfounded&quot; in a playful new video that finds the band at loggerheads over a parking spot. They set the scene:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Rick [bass, vocals] has paid for a parking space that [guitarist, keyboardist] Kevin&#39;s family had been using for generations. In order to resolve the dispute they agree to have a snowball fight. [Vocalist] Maryse backs Rick&#39;s claim to the parking while [drummer] Jesse is loyal to a fault and pledges to fight along side Kevin. A violent snowball fight ensues.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You witness the snowy carnage at YouTube now.</p><p>Stoby released a record in January of 2020 titled <em>Shark Girl Shark Shark</em>, on which &quot;The Weather is Unfounded&quot; originally appeared. That track now anchors a four-song EP on Bandcamp, paired with a new song, a Frankie Cosmos cover, and a live acoustic recording. You can snag a download of the set at Bandcamp.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOo0dq0B700" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=chris_page><span class=artist-title><a href="https://chrispage.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Chris Page</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Soul Correcting&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://chrispage.bandcamp.com/track/soul-correcting" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Ottawa garage vet <a href="https://chrispage.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Chris Page</a> continues to share previously unheard archival material like clockwork, this past month unveiling a recording of &quot;Soul Correcting.&quot; Page commented on the track at Bandcmap, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;...&#39;Soul Correcting&#39; is a song I&#39;ve played live for years, but never released. (And almost every time I&#39;ve played this song, John Higney strummed a tenor guitar beside me. And it was always so good.)</p><p>This version is one I recorded alone recently (and by recently, I mean WELL before pandemic times) and it&#39;s just the right amount of raw. There are no plugins on this. No EQ. I barely set levels. This is how the recording came up. Waving at me.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>When not stuck in lockdown, Chris Page plays as part of the duo <a href="https://expandafuzz.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Expanda Fuzz</a>.

When I was an early teen, it was one of the first sounds I heard that was not country music and it has been a part of my existence since.

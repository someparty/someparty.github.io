Luckily for us, Chance Hutchison of the garage-punks <a href="https://priorsmtl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>PRIORS</a> and Jackie Blenkarn of the feel-good rock&#39;n&#39;roll quartet <a href="https://palelips.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pale Lips</a> just happen to be husband and wife. The couple tells me they&#39;ve been recording &quot;pretty much nonstop,&quot; and those tunes are now starting to surface online. Billed as <a href="http://chanceandjackie.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Chance &amp; Jackie</a>, the duo&#39;s posted two tracks with accompanying videos to YouTube, with the promise of more to come.</p><p>The act debuted with &quot;Dark Spots&quot; earlier this month, a tune that strikes a neat balance between PRIORS&#39; buzzing DEVO-core tendencies and the Pale Lips&#39; throwback boogie. That tune was quickly followed by &quot;Get Loose,&quot; which appeared as part of <a href="https://www.slovenly.com/" class="" target=_blank>Slovenly</a>&#39;s <em>Slovenly on the STOP</em> video series. Both tracks are delightfully stir crazy, mixing just the right amount of playfulness with some sinister undertones that feel just right for the moment. Each video makes ample use of the couple&#39;s Montreal home, and while the recurring setting is, of course, practical (and responsible), it underscores how active a character our dwellings become when they&#39;re inescapable.</p><p>PRIORS last released <em>New Pleasure</em>, their sophomore full-length, paired with a quick follow-up EP titled <em>Call For You</em>. Both arrived on Slovenly. The group had been prepping their next LP before the pandemic hit. Chance, who was known for <a href="https://sonicavenues.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sonic Avenues</a> before PRIORS came together, also recently shared a set of home recordings under the name <a href="http://cosmicclub.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Cosmic Club</a>.</p><p><a href="https://palelips.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pale Lips</a> released <em>After Dark</em> in 2019 on a host of labels (<a href="https://www.godscandyrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>God&#39;s Candy</a> in Canada, <a href="http://www.aliensnatch.de/" class="" target=_blank>Alien Snatch!</a>, <a href="http://watersliderecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Waterslide</a>, and <a href="https://spaghettytownrecords.bigcartel.com/" class="" target=_blank>Spaghetty Town</a> elsewhere).

The EP features six songs, with longtime Romano contributor <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kennethroymeehan/" class="" target=_blank>Kenneth Roy Meehan</a> mixing and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jondrewrecording/" class="" target=_blank>Jon Drew</a> mastering.

Danny was no help placing <em>Super Pollen</em> into that timeline, claiming &quot;I have no idea when any of it was recorded, and I definitely don&#39;t remember doing it.&quot;</p><p>A week or so into self-quarantine, Danny released a 10-song alt-country record titled <em>&quot;Visions Of The Higher Dream&quot;</em>. Before that, his live band The Outfit saw their US tour supporting the new live album <em>&quot;Okay Wow&quot;</em> cancelled. That record&#39;s out on vinyl now from <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed</a>. Before this most recent round of touring, Danny&#39;s last proper full-length (whatever that means these days) was 2018&#39;s <em>Finally Free</em>.</p><p>Haliechuk and Falco have been all over the news these past few weeks with simultaneous releases landing from their side projects <a href="https://jadehairpins.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jade Hairpins</a> and <a href="https://masterpiecemachine.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Masterpiece Machine</a>. The former&#39;s a synthpop act who&#39;ve been building up to the May release of their <em>Harmony Avenue</em> full-length. The latter&#39;s an industrial trio featuring vocals from Riley Gale of the Dallas thrash titans <a href="https://powertripsl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Power Trip</a>.

The ensemble specializes in the kulintang (a percussive instrument laid out as a series of brass gongs) while incorporating modern synths and kick drums to create a sound that&#39;s compelling and unique. The label recently released &quot;V V V (They Lie),&quot; the record&#39;s second single. You can check it out below.</p><p>In a statement the band commented on the song, drawing a food analogy to its composition:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We wrote &#39;V V V (They Lie)&#39; in a day. We were having bubble tea at that time and the song just came together intuitively. The composition of the song was a lot like a cup of bubble tea. We added 2 cups of blended percussion as the base, then some analog synth tapioca pearls to keep the texture interesting and fun, and finally topped it off with a few tablespoons of fresh tropical vocal fruits for some added sweetness.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Pantayo worked in the studio with <a href="http://ytstlabs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Yamantaka // Sonic Titan</a>&#39;s Alaska B producing. They recorded their eight-song full-length in Toronto between 2016 and 2019, with lyrics that reflect upon the group&#39;s identities both as members of a diaspora but also the queer community.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=300 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/748981291&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" class=lazyload></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/telephoneexplosion/5-v-v-v-they-lie" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Pantayo - &quot;V V V (They Lie)&quot; @ SoundCloud</a></p><p>Toronto punk luminaries <a href="http://www.puptheband.com/" class="" target=_blank>PUP</a> have a new single out. I&#39;m not entirely sure if &quot;Anaphylaxis&quot; comes from the <em>Morbid Stuff</em> sessions or if it represents a true bout of follow-up songwriting, but it&#39;s undoubtedly more put together than your typical quarantine recording. Here&#39;s what the band&#39;s Stefan Babcock had to say about the tune in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I got the idea for the song when I was at my partner&#39;s cottage and her cousin got stung by a bee and his whole head started to swell up. His wife, although she was concerned, also thought it was pretty hilarious and started making fun of him even as they were headed to the hospital. He ended up being totally fine, but it was just funny to watch him freaking out and her just lighting him up at the same time. It reminded me of all the times I&#39;ve started panicking for whatever reason and was convinced I was dying and the world was ending and no one would take me seriously. In retrospect, I always find those overreactions pretty funny. So we wrote a goofy song about being a hypochondriac and tried to make our guitars sound like bees at the beginning of it.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track arrives alongside a claymation video by Callum Scott-Dyson. It follows a recent home-recording from Babcock dubbed &quot;Waiting For Something to Happen,&quot; which surfaced on <a href="https://youtu.be/YpCHoDVqp64" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> earlier in April.</p><p>PUP last released <em>Morbid Stuff</em> in 2019 on Rise Records in the States and the band&#39;s <a href="http://www.littledipperart.com/" class="" target=_blank>Little Dipper</a> imprint in Canada. The album, the group&#39;s third, landed them land on the Polaris Music Prize short list.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWNyNg3SVqk" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/PWNyNg3SVqk" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: PUP - &quot;Anaphylaxis&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto power-pop act <a href="http://www.prettymatty.com" class="" target=_blank>Pretty Matty</a> recently released a killer little punk tune on a split with the Nashville duo Sad Baxter.

In it, you&#39;ll find Matty Morand and <a href="https://ponytheband.ca/" class="" target=_blank>PONY</a>&#39;s Sam Bielanski cast as detectives investigating a murder (with Matty, or at least a doppelganger, also playing the victim and the perpetrator).</p><p>The Sad Baxter split arrived in early March from <a href="http://head2wallrecords.bigcartel.com/product/pretty-matty-sad-baxter-split-7" class="" target=_blank>Head 2 Wall Records</a>.

Perfect song for a video – and a perfect video for it.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Honey</em> arrived in May of last year from Constellation. A supporting tour of the United Kingdom and continental Europe, the band&#39;s first trip abroad, was recently scrapped due to the pandemic.

The record, recorded over the past month, continues Friesen&#39;s exploration of guitar-based drone music and experimental soundscapes. It&#39;s also a quick follow-up to the <em>Distants</em> EP released in March. When that earlier set arrived, the musician commented on his ambitions for an accelerated pace this year:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;My plan this year is to release something digitally every month or so, so as to both thin out my archives and publish new works more promptly without going broke making physical editions of everything. For much of the past decade I have been playing and recording compulsively for my own needs and amusement, a constant workbook. my hope is that releasing material in this way will help me move on from old recordings that I want available but never released for some reason or another, as well as be more current in sharing this bitter fictions thing I do.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>These two releases follow the November single <em>Fall Into Snow</em> and before that the <em>Walker</em> album from May of 2019. These collections are all available via Friesen&#39;s Montreal-based <a href="https://shakingboxmusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Shaking Box</a> label.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3501579084/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://bitterfictions.bandcamp.com/album/eloquent-despairing">eloquent &amp; despairing by Bitter Fictions</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://bitterfictions.bandcamp.com/album/eloquent-despairing" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Bitter Fictions - <em>Eloquent &amp; Despairing</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p><a href="https://www.theflatliners.com" class="" target=_blank>Flatliners</a> frontman <a href="https://chriscresswell.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Chris Cresswell</a> spent some of his time in isolation recording a thematically-apt set of cover songs.

You can stream the pop-rock band&#39;s personal and slow-burning &quot;December Snow,&quot; which dropped alongside a feature interview by the venerable website&#39;s Eric Scharf.

In the interview, Bell comments on the tune:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song might actually have been one of the early demo ideas I had, but something about the mood and the laid back style of it really struck me. I love 90&#39;s indie rock, and specifically 90&#39;s Canadian indie rock, so the feel of this song made me nostalgic for that. I had completed the entire song—guitars, bass, drums etc., but almost bailed on it several times because I just couldn&#39;t get lyrics finished. I scrapped and re-wrote them half a dozen times. It may have been the first song I chose, but it was the last one on the record to be completed.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Oswald Park arrives with an EP this Friday titled <em>A Prescription Year</em>. Bell recorded these seven songs in Richmond, Ontario, with production assistance from Scott McCash (a.k.a. Crusades&#39; Skottie Lobotomy) and Statues&#39; Rob Seaton.

The group commented on the piece, which periodically interrupts their performance with vintage news clips to drive home their social message:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This intense yet dance-able song is about the cycle of violence and what it will take to get those who commit these acts the same or equal punishment as those who live with the scars of domestic violence and sexual assault.

Gillespie</a>, the bassist of the Toronto noise-punk band <a href="https://greys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Greys</a>, is releasing a new collection of ambient soundscapes titled <em>Concentration Patterns</em>. The hypnotic, 75-minute set arrives as a double LP through Hidden Harmony Recordings, packaged alongside a set of instructions to help listeners tap into the music&#39;s purported therapeutic properties. Here&#39;s an excerpt from those notes:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Exploring an enveloping spectrum of tonal space, the intention and pseudo-theory of <em>Concentration Patterns</em> is that of aural therapy, meant to assist in the practice of meditation, mindfulness, and the development of healthy sleep cycles. When played at a comfortable volume (~ 70dB) with possible utilization of indirect listening to exaggerate the low frequency spectrum (fig.1), the listener may disassociate from their surroundings into the synthetic headspace of the extended piece. While listening, allow your body to ingest the hum of these simple and relatively affordable machines.</p><p>The unavoidable breakup of the whole within the vinyl format gives the unique opportunity to accentuate the listening experience by suggesting the pairing of pure sine tones, their frequency values indicated above, giving a tonal fulcrum to each side. This concept, sometimes described as binaural beats therapy, posits that concentrated listening to slightly-varying stereo frequencies can lead to decreased anxiety and &#39;increased quality of life&#39;. Conversely, vibroacoustic therapy, alleging that specific low-frequencies may positively resonate within the body&#39;s deep tissue, faces far more apathetic criticism; yet I would be remiss in discouraging this passing consideration during enjoyment of <em>Concentration Patterns</em>.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>If you want to give that &quot;binaural beats therapy&quot; thing a shot, C.R.&#39;s linked to an online <a href="https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/" class="" target=_blank>sine tone generator</a> that you can experiment with.</p><p>Greys last released <em>Age Hasn&#39;t Spoiled You</em>, their third full length, in 2019 on <a href="http://carparkrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Carpark Records</a>.

What&#39;s remarkable about this moment is that we&#39;re seeing those creative journeys reverberate into the real world as life awkwardly resumes some normalcy. I&#39;ll admit that before the pandemic, I was utterly oblivious to the fact that Jackie Blenkarn of Montreal rock quartet the <a href="https://palelips.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pale Lips</a> was married to Chance Hutchison of garage-punks <a href="https://priorsmtl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>PRIORS</a>, despite being a fan of both bands. Their creative paths never seemed to cross before that time, or at least not insofar as I knew. Stuck at home together, the duo churned out a small set of isolation songs as <a href="http://chanceandjackie.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Chance &amp; Jackie</a>, striking an excellent balance between PRIORS&#39; warped DEVOcore buzz and the Lips&#39; throwback boogie.</p><p>That project&#39;s since evolved into <a href="https://privatelivesmtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Private Lives</a>, a fully realized four-piece now on the cusp of issuing their debut EP. The band features Blenkarn on vocals and Hutchison on guitar, baked by <a href="https://thelonelyparade.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lonely Parade</a>&#39;s Frank Climenhage on drums and Josh Herlihey on bass. The group recorded their five-song self-titled debut with frequent PRIORS collaborator Adrian Popovich, crafting a set of songs that weave threads from classic punk, atmospheric post-punk, and surf. You can now hear the track &quot;All The Queen&#39;s Men&quot; at Bandcamp, and keep an eye on Cincinnati&#39;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/feelitrecordshop/" class="" target=_blank>Feel It Records</a> for the cassette release.</p><p>You can get in on the ground floor with Private Lives at a few upcoming shows. They&#39;ll play next Tuesday (October 11) in Montreal with Silicone Prairie, Snooper, and Joe Chamandy&#39;s <a href="https://totalpunkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/reverberant-scratch-9-shots-in-tha-dark" class="" target=_blank>Tha Retail Simps</a>. The group&#39;s also making an Ontario trek to play <a href="https://anxiouspleasers.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Anxious Pleasers</a> LP release party in Hamilton on November 11 alongside Bad Crush.</p><p>PRIORS issued the <em>NEWNENEW</em> EP in the spring as a follow-up to their 2020 LP <em>My Punishment On Earth</em>. Earlier this year, The Pale Lips shared a cover of The Go-Go&#39;s&#39; classic &quot;Get Up and Go,&quot; part of the tribute album <em>If You Gotta GO-GO, GO-GO Now</em>. It was one of the first new recordings they&#39;ve shared since the 2019 release of their <em>After Dark</em> LP.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1003622490/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://privatelivesmtl.bandcamp.com/album/private-lives">Private Lives by Private Lives</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=layten_kramer><span class=artist-title><a href="https://laytenkramer.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Layten Kramer</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Employment&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/xb1dnKvXrdY" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://niceguysweare.bandcamp.com/track/employment" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Canmore psych-folk artist <a href="https://laytenkramer.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Layten Kramer</a> recently shared the title track to his upcoming EP, <em>Employment</em>. The tune&#39;s a synth-driven ballad with a laid-back vibe that should appeal to fans of Astral Swans&#39; lush arrangements and No Frills&#39; languid sense of chill. The French label <a href="https://niceguysweare.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Nice Guys</a> are backing the record.

The artist&#39;s new full-length under the guise of <a href="https://context-na.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Context, NA</a> may prove an enigma regardless, dabbling in expansive post-punk soundscapes reminiscent of Cindy Lee and The Microphones. Pappo commented on the 12-song project:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I was thinking about my musical roots and the naivete of making something, but also the obsession with a melody or riff that won&#39;t escape you. The title appeared to me midway through recording. I knew that I needed to get out of this world because I can&#39;t live inside it forever.. When I sing &#39;what do you want out of this world?&#39; it&#39;s like I&#39;m asking the album what it wants from me... The joke is that you can&#39;t get out, because when you finish the record you&#39;re right back to where you started...</p><p>&quot;These are for better or for worse very personal recordings. They&#39;re almost naively sincere in some ways. I tried to combine all of these reference points to create something I like, which is usually a maximalist mess. I love to create layers of sound where there are intrusions.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Today, y can start your journey through the complete set, issued through <a href="https://remainsrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Remains Records</a> at Bandcamp.

We all know what happened instead. The band finally got it together with their newly available <em>Authenticity E.P.</em>, a five-song set that gives that song a home among four brand-new tracks. Of those, I&#39;m at just the right age to delight in the reference-packed &quot;1994-1998.&quot; I suspect many of my readers are too.</p><p>These new tracks were recorded and mixed by NQ Arbuckle&#39;s John Dinsmore (PUP, Talk Show Host) at the Lincoln County Social Club in Toronto.

And you? You eerily love every minute of it. It tricks you into thinking this is now your life, drenched in evil. It will haunt you until the end. How can you break the curse? &#39;Silence Is A Killer&#39; is a lyric video following a Trevisani recipe on how to remove a malocchio, or at least buy some time: boil and burn all the feathers in your pillow, then throw them in the river.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Sara May of <a href="https://www.falconjane.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Falcon Jane</a> directed the &quot;Silence is a Killer&quot; video.</p><p>Bonnie Trash features guitarist Emmalia and drummer/vocalist Sarafina Bortolon-Vettor.

Page commented on &quot;Do You Remember,&quot; recorded as his home in Vanier this past September:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Sometimes you stumble on old cassette tapes from a long gone answering machine and find one that has an old crush playing mandolin, making up songs for you, having paid the long distance charges like the feelings were somehow mutual.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In addition to these multi-faceted singles, Page recently issued <em>Those Aren&#39;t Stars Above Your Head</em>, an acoustic reworking of <a href="https://campradio.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Camp Radio</a>&#39;s 2006 self-titled LP.

The song finds Rodriguez working closely with co-writer and producer <a href="https://superhotmixes.com/" class="" target=_blank>Phil Hirst</a>. In a statement, Leena comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I think at one point in our lives, we&#39;ve had little harmless crushes on our friends and I feel like as a queer person having these feelings for your friends of the same sex while still trying to figure yourself out is a little wild and scary and this song is a little bit about that...</p><p>Originally when I started writing the verses I was just complaining about my friends being in love and feeling like a third wheel. Once I got to the chorus, I had mad writer&#39;s block and didn&#39;t know how to continue until I thought to myself, &#39;What if it&#39;s not really about me hating being the third wheel but rather being jealous because I secretly have a crush on my friend?&#39; I felt in complete denial about it but eventually these feelings became so strong that I couldn&#39;t ignore them. I took that intention and finished the song so quickly.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Live, MBG features Rodrigues on vocals and guitar, Hirst on guitar, Rafael Callejas on bass, and Morgan Dunbar drumming.

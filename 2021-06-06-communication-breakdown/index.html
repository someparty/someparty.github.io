I have no firm evidence confirming that the Halifax punk quartet <a href="https://cluttered.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Cluttered</a> has indeed achieved such a state, but it feels like it. Something&#39;s in the air. <a href="http://mattygrace.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Matty Grace</a> was busy even in pre-pandemic times, fronting <a href="https://futuregirls.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Future Girls</a>, playing with <a href="https://weekenddads.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Weekend Dads</a>, <a href="https://outtacontroller.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Outtacontroller</a>, Cutie, and others, not to mention amassing a solo catalogue of respectable post-Against Me! folk-punk jams. In the stilted past year, she&#39;s somehow found the energy for numerous home recording projects, notably releasing a tape of pure frustration-core rockers as <a href="https://moderncynics.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Modern Cynics</a> and providing the backbone for the energetic rebirth of mandopop rockers <a href="https://centuryegg.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Century Egg</a>. So what separates Cluttered from the pack? Don&#39;t bore me with your Spotify stats - my gut says it&#39;s pure momentum - momentum in its most nebulous, qualitative form. Magic stuff. Spooky action at a distance. Cluttered has it.</p><p><em>Accidents</em> arrived last week as the group&#39;s second EP, following a self-titled demo from the winter. The set still shows hallmarks of socially distanced constraints, with Grace handling the bass, guitar, and lead vocals. Outside of drummer Dylan Mombourquete (of Alright Already) the remainder of Cluttered&#39;s roster are, thus far, only credited with vocals. Becca Dalley (<a href="https://designosaur.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Designosaur</a>, <a href="https://bookbuddies.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Book Buddies</a>) and Danny Bailey (Jabber) appear in that regard - but you&#39;d be wrong to minimize their roles. If there&#39;s some secret ingredient that sets Cluttered apart from Grace&#39;s prolific solo catalogue, they may be it. With AJ Boutilier notably on reserve for some future live version of the group, it&#39;s evident that Cluttered isn&#39;t what it intends to become. Strangely, wonderfully perhaps, that doesn&#39;t really matter. <em>Accidents</em> feels fully formed, despite the circumstances. There&#39;s no IOU here.</p><p>The four-song set wraps with &quot;The Toll,&quot; a track that notably features backing vocals from Cassia Hardy of Edmonton&#39;s luminous <a href="https://wares.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Wares</a>. Cluttered debuted the EP with the urgent &quot;Don&#39;t Hold Your Breath.&quot; Grace spoke to <a href="https://thebadcopy.com/news/stream/cluttered-premieres-first-single-announces-new-ep/" class="" target=_blank>The Bad Copy</a> in a feature premiering the track, commenting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The song is about that feeling when you open your eyes and you&#39;ve immediately exhausted before even starting your day. The doom-scrolling, the shitty tweets, the eye-rolling all combine into this need to self-medicate just to exist all while living through a worldwide pandemic and working a menial-brain-numbing job to try and make rent. Everything feels terrible all the time and sometimes it feels like it&#39;s not going to change so don&#39;t hold your breath.</p><p>This EP, <em>Accidents</em>, is very much written from a place of reflection on the past couple years and how I ended up where I have. Personal growth is hard and I&#39;m still left wondering just how many shitty jobs you have to work to try and survive in a city that just wants to build a condo on your corpse.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Accidents</em> arrived last week from Iowa &#39;dirt pop&#39; purveyors <a href="https://bloatedkatrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bloated Kat Records</a>. Grace and Mombourquette recorded the songs in various locations, with the latter mixing. Will Killingsworth mastered the set at Dead Air. You can find it at Bandcamp now.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4055486873/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://cluttered.bandcamp.com/album/accidents">Accidents by Cluttered</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=the_garrys><span class=artist-title><a href="https://thegarrys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Garrys</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Get Thee to a Nunnery&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://thegarrys.bandcamp.com/track/get-thee-to-a-nunnery" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>It&#39;s an eye-rolling thing to say, given that they recently scored a vintage film about witchcraft, but there&#39;s something absolutely <em>haunting</em> about Saskatoon surf trio <a href="https://thegarrys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Garrys</a>. The group recently announced <em>Get Thee To a Nunnery</em>, a new full-length due September 24 through <a href="https://greyrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Grey Records</a>. The sister act&#39;s notably also found a kindred spirit in Dallas Good. <a href="https://www.thesadies.net/" class="" target=_blank>The Sadies</a>&#39; celebrated guitar wizard serves as producer on the 11-track set. Given the career Good&#39;s made trading in vintage cool, he&#39;s perfectly suited to tease that out from The Garrys&#39; smokey &#39;doom-wop.&#39;</p><p>You can hear the record&#39;s title track now, a song that harkens back to the religious attitudes of Saskatchewan in the 60s. A press release elaborates on the complicated tension between the group&#39;s nostalgic tendencies and the truth of the past:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;On lead track &quot;Get Thee to a Nunnery&quot;, The Garrys playfully explore the push-pull of rebellion and redemption that comes within a religious upbringing, and the seeding of persistent guilt that all former Catholic school kids know well. The album and this track in particular were inspired by stories from the band&#39;s mother of her teenage years at an all-girls boarding school and convent in small-town 1960&#39;s Saskatchewan. Even for artists as reverentially nostalgic as The Garrys, it&#39;s impossible to avoid grappling with the tensions that arise from their sources of aesthetic inspiration. On one hand, they look upon this era and environment as timelessly cool, and coloured with a sepia-toned innocence; on the other, they know it was inescapably repressive to young women and various &#39;others&#39;.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song&#39;s featured in an animated video by <a href="https://bbqtband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>BBQT</a>&#39;s Amery Sanford, as previewed last month as part of the <a href="https://lawnyavawnya.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lawnya Vawnya</a> festival. You&#39;ll find it on YouTube this Friday. The Garrys recorded and mixed the new album with Barrett Ross at Rec Hall Studios, with Harris Newman mastering at Grey Market.</p><p>The Garrys features sisters Erica, Julie, and Lenore Maier. In 2020 the trio released an acclaimed retroactive score for the 1922 film <em>Häxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages</em>. Their last proper full-length, <em>Surf Manitou</em>, arrived in 2017.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3844332148/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://thegarrys.bandcamp.com/track/get-thee-to-a-nunnery">Get Thee to a Nunnery by The Garrys</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=real_sickies><span class=artist-title><a href="https://realsickies.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Real Sickies</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://realsickies.bandcamp.com/track/communication-breakdown" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>I&#39;m in awe of the livewire energy that Edmonton&#39;s <a href="https://realsickies.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Real Sickies</a> exude in everything they do. While their fervent devotion to the Ramones and Teenage Head may imply some nostalgic constraints, singles like &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; feel youthful and immediate. The track heralds the pop-punk group&#39;s new LP <em>Love is for Lovers</em>, arriving July 9 through <a href="https://stomprecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stomp Records</a>. It&#39;s the group&#39;s first full-length since their pandemic-anchored 2020 LP <em>Quarantined</em>, featuring 14 new tracks with guest appearances from Dave Bacon (<a href="http://www.realmckenzies.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Real McKenzies</a>/<a href="http://snfu.ca/" class="" target=_blank>SNFU</a>) and dream pop singer <a href="http://www.lucettemusic.net" class="" target=_blank>Lucette</a>.</p><p>2020&#39;s <em>Quarantined</em> found the group writing and producing an entire full-length in seven days to raise funds for the WHO&#39;s COVID-19 Response Fund.

Vocalist Shawn Tucker commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;You can direct the pain from loss in both healthy and self-destructive ways. Eventually you just feel numb from it all and dream of a day when the hurt finally stops.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>The Sick, Tired and Ill</em> serves as the group&#39;s first release for the young <a href="http://freak-wave.com/" class="" target=_blank>Freakwave</a> label. Look for the release on July 2 as a 10&quot; record, limited to a run of 500. TRAITRS features Shawn Tucker and Sean-Patrick Nolan.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CuKUvZi-Vok" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=ship_of_fools><span class=artist-title><a href="https://sofpunk.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ship of Fools</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Open for Business&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/EGv6pCiv-mA" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://sofpunk.bandcamp.com/track/open-for-business" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Political Newmarket punks <a href="https://sofpunk.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ship of Fools</a> recently shared a video celebrating &quot;Open for Business,&quot; their timely Doug Ford takedown from the spring&#39;s <em>Status Quo</em> EP.

Being a fan of stop animation, the skating Rat Fink just made sense… I love the fact that this band is still so D.I.Y.

The group&#39;s releasing the 13-song <em>Is The Idea Of Us</em> on August 7, a stretch of over three and a half years from their last record, the celebrated 10&quot; EP <em>More</em>. The group previewed the set with the single &quot;Ploce,&quot; which arrived alongside an animated video from Amy Lockhart. New Fries commented on their much-heralded lateral approach to songwriting in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;New Fries has never been interested in being a band. What we mean is a spirit of abandoning ideas of what songs should be, how they should be performed, and by whom. We&#39;ve never been interested in the tradition of songwriting—though we&#39;re interested in musical elements like repetition, space, and dynamics. We have wanted our music to make people dance but have also wanted to produce the feeling of that being taken away from a room. We often work around these sorts of energy transfers (whether or not we name them this way). This space to make music in has felt wild and free. We have also contradicted ourselves. We are also always changing.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In the year following <em>More</em>, New Fries parted ways with keyboardist Ryan Carley, reconfiguring as a three-piece with the remaining members swapping instruments. This current incarnation of the group finds vocalist Anni Spadafora moving to bass, trading places with Tim Fagan (who&#39;s also now manning a sampler on stage), meanwhile drummer Jenny Gitman&#39;s paired back her drum kit to three pieces. The group recorded <em>Is The Idea Of Us</em> with <a href="https://carldidur.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Carl Didur</a> of the Toronto psych duo <a href="https://zachtautomaat.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Zacht Automaat</a> serving as producer.</p><p>If you had any doubt of the band&#39;s commitment to forgoing the usual structures, they&#39;ve generically titled no less than six songs on the record &quot;Genre&quot; to hammer that point home.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YugPKGKAnbw" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/YugPKGKAnbw" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: New Fries - &quot;Ploce&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>I try not to position this newsletter an overt <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a> fan club, I really do, but this pandemic hasn&#39;t had a week without something new from the Welland singer-songwriter.</p><p>Last week Danny released <em>Content To Point The Way</em>, a 10-song collection credited to his touring band The Outfit. The set was recorded just a week before release, with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kennethroymeehan/" class="" target=_blank>Kenneth Roy Meehan</a> mixing. This version of The Outfit, who all collaborated remotely while in quarantine, featured <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidjnardi/" class="" target=_blank>Dave Nardi</a>, <a href="https://jr-sings.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>J.R.</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roddy_rodderson/" class="" target=_blank>Roddy Rosetti</a>, <a href="http://www.marklalama.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mark Lalama</a>, Aaron Goldstein (<a href="https://espanola.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Espanola</a>), and, of course, Danny&#39;s steadfast brother Ian Romano drumming. The set marks a confident return to the authentic country stylings of Danny&#39;s earlier solo records, like 2013&#39;s <em>Come Cry With Me</em> or 2015&#39;s <em>If I&#39;ve Only One Time Askin&#39;</em>.</p><p>This album follows a flood of new material from Romano over the past few months. Running backwards down the calendar, you&#39;ll first find the <em>Super Pollen</em> EP (Danny and Ian joined by <a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a>&#39;s Jonah Falco and Mike Haliechuk). That was just a week ago. Before that, the full-length <em>&quot;Visions Of The Higher Dream&quot;</em> started his isolation run. Just prior to the shutdown, The Outfit was on the road supporting the newly released <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed</a> live set <em>&quot;Okay Wow&quot;</em>. <em>A Flower That Wouldn&#39;t Bloom</em>, the third record from Ancient Shapes (The Outfit reconstituted as a punk group) arrived in late 2019, and before that came, oh, let&#39;s say three solo LPs in 2018. Content to point the way, as it is.</p><p>...and lest anyone accuse him of wasting time, just a few days ago Danny also released a book of 100 love poems titled <em>At Last There Is No End</em>. You can find that and everything above at Bandcamp.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1423581538/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://danielromano.bandcamp.com/album/content-to-point-the-way">Content To Point The Way by Daniel Romano</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com/album/content-to-point-the-way" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Daniel Romano - <em>Content To Point The Way</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>On May 22, <a href="https://stomprecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stomp Records</a> debuts the first LP from Montreal melodic punk quartet <a href="http://lesmainssalesmontreal.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Les Mains Sales</a>.

Of particular curiosity is the set&#39;s final track, a cover of <a href="https://www.simplysaucer.com/" class="" target=_blank>Simply Saucer</a>&#39;s &quot;Illegal Bodies&quot; featuring that band&#39;s frontman, Edgar Breau. TV Freaks commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Craig from <a href="https://schizophrenicrex.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Schizophrenic</a> had introduced us to Edgar Breau from Simply Saucer and convinced us to work on a record together. After exchanging a few emails, we asked Edgar to come down to a rehearsal at Bachelor&#39;s Paradise on December 9 2014. Here we ran through &#39;Illegal Bodies&#39; a couple times together, smoked a joint, and then laid this take down live off the floor. Dave did the vocals a few days later. To date, this is the only document of this would-be Saucer Freaks record. Hopefully we&#39;ll get our shit together one day to pull it off (sorry Craig!).&quot;</p></blockquote><p>More Saucer Freaks, please. A rough mix of this track appeared as part of a digital compilation released alongside Jesse Locke&#39;s book <em>Heavy Metalloid Music: The Story of Simply Saucer</em>.

Like the earlier editions, which date back to 2015, this tape features a mix of interviews, rarities, and a smattering of songs from other bands. <em>Mixtape 6</em>, which doesn&#39;t yet have a physical release, includes covers of Blitz, the Ramones, Alanis Morrissette, and the Grateful Dead, among others. There&#39;s a preview of <em>Year of the Horse</em>, the next entry Fucked Up&#39;s <a href="http://zodiac.fuckedup.cc" class="" target=_blank>Zodiac series</a>, in the mix as well.

Here&#39;s the story:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;On March 4, S.H.I.T. played Idryma 2.14 in Athens. A lot of punks in Athens worked to make that happen. Among them were the members of Chain Cult. I had spent months working with them before this, planning their first North American tour. Gear had been sent, merch had been printed, flights had been bought.</p><p>A week and one day later, we were back in Toronto and all flights had been banned from Europe to the US As our collective new reality set in, the tour was amongst the casualties. They were supposed to play Toronto, tonight. April 30.</p></blockquote><p>S.H.I.T. will also produce tapes of the show, titled <em>Συναυλία στο ίδρυμα 2.14</em>, for release on the <a href="https://www.lavidaesunmus.com/" class="" target=_blank>La Vida Es En Mus</a> label.

The band&#39;s in the process of pairing down nearly 30 newly recorded songs into manageable tracklist, with a series of two-song singles planned to give the cut B-sides a home. This first salvo pairs &quot;Swim&quot; with &quot;Optical Illusion Part II,&quot; a track you can pick up on <a href="http://papalvisit.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a>.

I&#39;m always up for a swim wherever I go. That&#39;s a big part of summer in the Maritimes. This song was also inspired by a trip home to Saint John the summer before last. It was one of those great visits where you just find yourself running into people constantly, some you haven&#39;t seen in years.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Mowery formed Papal Visit after moving to Halifax as a way to stay connected with the Saint John music scene he came up in. Working remotely with Pierre Cormier and a revolving group of New Brunswick musicians, he&#39;s put out a wealth of material over the past few years, most recently the 2019 live album <em>Prepare For Your Reversal</em>. The new record, which doesn&#39;t yet have a name, will be the band&#39;s first LP since 2017&#39;s <em>Garden Grove</em>. Papal Visit&#39;s current line-up features Mowery on vocals and Cormier playing bass along with guitarist Jason Ogden, guitarist Chris Braydon, and drummer Geoffrey Smith.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nuzakWQsEAI" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/nuzakWQsEAI" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Papal Visit - &quot;Where Do They Swim?&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p><a href="http://www.wearetheburninghell.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Burning Hell</a>&#39;s had a busy quarantine, keeping active not only with the promotion of Ariel Sharratt and Mathias Kom&#39;s new record of duets, but through several hours of their &quot;high-quality television show&quot; <a href="https://youtu.be/rRHehhtX5Qg" class="" target=_blank><em>Everything Will Probably Be OK</em></a>.

The piece features seven players, including the aforementioned Pierre Cormier of Papal Visit, Colleen Collins of <a href="https://constructionanddestruction.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Construction &amp; Destruction</a>, Jennifer Nason (a.k.a. Juniper), and Andrew MacKelvie of <a href="https://newhermitage.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>New Hermitage</a>. They join the regular Usse players of Jud Crandall, Emily Saab, and Sebastian Fleet on the lengthy song. In a statement the band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>CAPITALIST BRAIN PARTY no. 2</em> is a manufactured album length improvisation, built by seven players on the foundation of a field recording of pummeling rain on a structure. Given the task of responding to what preceded and constructing space for what follows, each player laid sheet upon sheet of sound sequentially in isolation. Arranged as a &#39;double quartet&#39;, in a playful nod to Ornette Coleman&#39;s &#39;Free Jazz&#39;, occupation of this space is rendered with minimal interference, beyond simply placing the isolated players in this virtual space. First takes were encouraged, and preparation was limited to steeling oneself to stay the course once playing had begun.</p><p>Just as in a live improvisation, empathy, imagination and accommodation were paramount, seeking to discover the togetherness of a collective organism, in spite of that which separates us. While the COVID pandemic very much set the stage for this experiment, the true watershed of our social fabric, revealing itself today as much as any time, is the unequal, non-neutral construct of capitalism. <em>CAPITALIST BRAIN PARTY no. 2</em> recognizes and stands in defiance of this cruel house in which we are made to live, work and struggle.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This track&#39;s one of several recent releases from the group, including April&#39;s cover of &quot;The Future&quot; (Prince&#39;s contribution to the &#39;89 <em>Batman</em> flick), and the <em>Rags of Destruction</em> split with the Gatineau electronic duo <a href="https://hdeheutz.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>H. de Heutz</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2173352157/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://usse.bandcamp.com/album/capitalist-brain-party-no-2">Capitalist Brain Party no. 2 by Usse</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://usse.bandcamp.com/album/capitalist-brain-party-no-2" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Usse - <em>Capitalist Brain Party no .2</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Hamilton rock group <a href="https://shaderocknroll.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Shade</a> recently unveiled their debut LP, a 10-song set of crunchy alt-rock throwbacks titled <em>Combat Rave</em>.

The No Wave unit, a project of Allie L. Torrance, released a three-song EP titled <em>Live At Boxcar</em>, recorded on March 1, 2019 at <a href="http://www.boxcarsoundrecording.com/" class="" target=_blank>Boxcar Sound Recording</a>. Torrance had this to say about the release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;People Who Use Drugs are not only experiencing a singular global health crisis (COVID-19), they are also continuing to experience the ongoing overdose crisis, which in recent weeks has seen a rising of overdoses at levels not seen since 2016. Individuals who are being told to self-isolate are doing so in a climate that tells them that their needs are unimportant, and they continue to be largely ignored in a crisis response. People are being pushed to use drugs alone, or to be ticketed for simply existing without homes or access to their communities. Now, more than ever, it is time to rise-up against criminal systems and moralistic views about drug use in our communities.</p><p>Providing a safe supply of drugs to people who use them is NOT a radical idea. In fact, it is happening, and people who have the power to prescribe need ACT NOW. In the wake of COVID-19 it is time for people to wake up and see that the disparities that the people who are marginalized within our communities experience, are not an individual &#39;problem&#39;. Rather, it is the systems which punish those who exist outside of a capitalistic driven ideology and world view that is the problem. People Who Use Drugs are people and they are members of our communities, they have value, they are smart, they are loving, they are kind, they deserve access to choice, to dignity, and to life.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Two of the songs here originate from <em>Garbage Head</em>, an EP Back Teeth released in the winter of 2018. Videos of the performances are online as well (&quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/RYlCypXe4Eg" class="" target=_blank>Gardens</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/BmAq4MGpr0A" class="" target=_blank>Garbage Head</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/QSs68GPzs7g" class="" target=_blank>Beaches</a>&quot;).

A video for &quot;We&#39;re All In this Together&quot; features the punk legend, accompanied by Burnaby mayor Mike Hurley, performing the track (at an appropriate 2 meters apart) in the city&#39;s Deer Lake Park. In a statement Keithley commented on the track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Writing this song was just natural as I saw the growing effort by our fellow Canadians to keep as many folks as possible safe throughout the pandemic. It&#39;s my way of thanking and expressing my admiration for the nurses, doctors and all the front line workers. They are the best!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>D.O.A. released a new album, their 18th, on March 15 via <a href="https://www.suddendeath.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sudden Death Records</a>.

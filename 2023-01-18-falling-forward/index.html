The melancholic &quot;Falling Forward&quot; arrives as the first follow-up to the band&#39;s 2021 debut <em>Swell</em>, expanding that on that album&#39;s classicly-minded emo roots with brief bursts of shoegaze noise. On the track, the artist revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The song comes from a place of trying to be comfortable with acknowledging when you fall into familiar patterns. I started to realize how many of my traits and habits I inherited from other people, some tendencies I liked and others I didn&#39;t. In &#39;Falling Forward,&#39; I try to acknowledge that even if I want to change some of these tendencies, others have ultimately made benefitted me. It&#39;s about trying to confront the ways you&#39;ve been reactionary, and acknowledging when that may or may not have served me.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Brown recorded the song in his new home studio and Matt Tomasi&#39;s Concrete Smile in Toronto&#39;s east end. Harris Newman mastered in Montreal at Grey Market Mastering. This looks to be the first reveal of a half-dozen new demos, so look for those as the year progresses.</p><p>Pillea&#39;s accomplished eight-song <em>Swell</em> arrived in May 2021 from Tennessee&#39;s <a href="https://linktr.ee/SunEaterRecords" class="" target=_blank>Sun Eater Records</a>. Before that milestone we perhaps knew him best as a frequent engineering credit on Some Party-showcased bands like <a href="https://bbqtband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>BBQT</a> and <a href="http://ccconditionerrr.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Conditioner</a>.

In December, the high-concept group issued <em>Undone in Otherspace</em>, a nine-song album featuring a slate of classic punk songs with pulp adventure trappings and a peppering of psychedelia. On paper, that may imply a strong Misfits lineage -- but the band&#39;s embrace of cool surf licks and their vocalist&#39;s oft-frantic, warbling delivery make a stronger case for the Dead Kennedys.</p><p>The band sold out of their initial run of records and tapes, and it&#39;s easy to see why. Rarely do you see a debut project so meticulously designed. <em>Undone in Otherspace</em> comes wrapped in absolutely eye-catching artwork, perfectly replicating the distressed look of a thoroughly thrashed 50s sci-fi novel. The album arrived both as a cassette (in a wonderfully vintage clamshell reminiscent of a VHS rental) and as a limited lathe cut LP. Like many of the lathes I&#39;ve featured here, this is a small batch crafted by Robyn Raymond at <a href="https://www.redspaderecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Red Spade Records</a>. Your only play, at this point, is to snag the audio from Bandcamp - but here&#39;s hoping that changes. The album arrived through DevilHouse Publishing, quite likely a label the band made up, but one that fits their pulp style perfectly.</p><p>In November of 2022, Teleporters shared a video for the single &quot;Forgetterman.&quot; Directed by the band&#39;s Matthew Ellis for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@badtastecinema705/" class="" target=_blank>Bad Taste Cinema</a>, it plays out like a fever dream of some low-budget X-Files knockoff. You can find it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTFT0nrkCpg" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2182653949/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://teleporters.bandcamp.com/album/undone-in-otherspace">Undone in Otherspace by Teleporters</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=cell_deth><span class=artist-title><a href="https://sewerciderex.bandcamp.com/album/cell-deth-demo" class="" target=_blank>Cell Deth</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Demo</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://sewerciderex.bandcamp.com/album/cell-deth-demo" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>It&#39;s been too long since we&#39;ve heard from our friends at <a href="https://sewerciderex.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Sewercide Records</a>, but the purveyors of only the scuzziest Maritime rackets came roaring back with the new demo from <a href="https://sewerciderex.bandcamp.com/album/cell-deth-demo" class="" target=_blank>Cell Deth</a>. The six-song collection&#39;s available in a one-time cassette run of 100 copies, showcasing the latest from Charlottetown&#39;s surprisingly fruitful punk and hardcore scene. You can hear the complete set digitally or pick up a tape at Bandcamp - either way, you&#39;ll be spoiled with nearly four entire minutes of breakneck, lo-fi chaos.</p><p>The group features <a href="https://antibodieschtn.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Antibodies</a> members Brett Sanderson and Ryan Kirkpatrick paired with Matt and Story Sheidow. The latter pair earlier played as the powerviolence duo <a href="https://uncle902.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Uncle</a>, and Matt&#39;s known as a member of the defunct PEI hardcore favourites <a href="https://acousmahc.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Acousma</a>.</p><p>Cell Deth is the second contemporary project from Story Sheidow we&#39;ve discussed recently. In December, we finally heard the debut EP from <a href="https://coycoycoy.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Coy</a>, her indie rock/pop-punk trio. That band recorded their <em>Bury Me</em> EP in 2019, only to see it temporarily swallowed in the early-pandemic black hole.</p><p>Antibodies last issued their plainly named <em>LP 2021</em> in (you guessed it) 2021.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=930692412/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://sewerciderex.bandcamp.com/album/cell-deth-demo">Cell Deth - Demo by Sewercide Records</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=apollo_ghosts><span class=artist-title><a href="https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Apollo Ghosts</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Gave Up The Dream&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/album/gave-up-the-dream" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Vancouver veterans <a href="https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Apollo Ghosts</a> have a new single out in concert with a newly announced slate of European tour dates. &quot;Gave Up The Dream&quot; is a gorgeous track, delivered with a lush mix by <a href="http://www.thenewpornographers.com/" class="" target=_blank>The New Pornographers</a>&#39; John Collins and mastered by Josh Stevenson.

In a press release, the band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;While working on the album, the idea of continuing as a guest felt very apropos to the times. Feeling out of place in culture, in society, being in a band that has been around for so long—not feeling like a part of any zeitgeist, but happy to be separate and living your simple life, your long fade-out. Living in a secluded place in an isolated time, it felt like a positive form of acceptance: find your own little nowhere, find some space to fall apart, continue as a guest.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The 10-song set, produced by A.C. Newman, kicks off with the single &quot;Really Really Light.&quot; The track&#39;s an evolution of material scrapped from the <em>Brill Bruisers</em> sessions, and as such carries a co-writing credit for sometimes-member Dan Bejar (2014-era Dan Bejar, to be precise). You can find it visualized on YouTube in a playful video from director Christian Cerezo.</p><p>This album finds most of the band&#39;s entire modern lineup returning, with Newman again joined by John Collins, Neko Case, Todd Fancey, Kathryn Calder, and Joe Seiders in various capacities. The record adds Zach Djanikian to the core group in several roles (notably saxophone), with Paul Rigby appearing on pedal steel. The new album follows up on 2019&#39;s <em>In the Morse Code of Brake Lights</em> and an extensive tour celebrating the concurrent anniversaries of 2005&#39;s <em>Twin Cinema</em> and the band&#39;s 2000 debut <em>Mass Romantic</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9oWiY61IbPE" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=heraclitus_akimbo_meets_psychic_surfer><span class=artist-title><a href="https://stargoon.bandcamp.com/album/sons-of-stargoon-ep" class="" target=_blank>Heraclitus Akimbo meets Psychic Surfer</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Sons of Stargoon</em> EP</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://stargoon.bandcamp.com/album/sons-of-stargoon-ep" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> - Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/liP6doF5whg" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Members of Toronto&#39;s &quot;spontaneous kosmische&quot; band <a href="https://stargoon.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Stargoon</a> recently issued an immersive four-song EP through Bandcamp. The Stargoon rhythm section of bassist Matthew Fava and drummer Luca Capone anchor the groovy instrumental set. The pair&#39;s performed in recent times under the name Psychic Surfer. Joe Strutt joins them on an array of synths and pedals, crafting a satisfyingly distinct yet lovingly krautrock-adjacent sound. Strutt should be instantly familiar to followers of the Toronto underground as chief &quot;citizen archivist&quot; of the long-running <a href="http://mechanicalforestsound.blogspot.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mechanical Forest Sound</a> blog. He&#39;s also built a decades-deep catalogue of lo-fi ambient sounds as <a href="https://heraclitusakimbo.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Heraclitus Akimbo</a>. Strutt&#39;s toybox on these recordings includes a Bastl Kastle 1.5 modular synthesizer, an EWI (electronic wind instrument), a Concertmate-500 keyboard, and an Empress ZOIA pedal/synth hybrid. The trio recorded in December of last year at Toronto&#39;s 918 Bathurst.</p><p>You can see a video for &quot;We&#39;re ghosts now, it&#39;s true&quot; on <a href="https://youtu.be/liP6doF5whg" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a>.

I spend more time on Discogs than IMDB, so in that spirit, this newsletter celebrates him not as a thespian but instead as the mighty Age of Danger from Toronto garage legends <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deadly_Snakes" class="" target=_blank>The Deadly Snakes</a>!</p><p>The new visuals line up with Max&#39;s appearance on Damian Abraham&#39;s <a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/8221681-max-mccabe-lokos-actor-director-and-former-deadly-snake" class="" target=_blank>Turned Out a Punk</a> podcast, where the pair discuss the Snakes&#39; legacy and reveal all sorts of fascinating details on an era of the Toronto punk scene that&#39;s woefully under-documented. The show hypes their conversation thusly:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;How does one retire from music? Damian sits down with one-time Deadly Snake, Max McCabe-Lokos to find out just that. Listen in as one of the greatest front-people Toronto ever produced talks about punk, why Toronto sucks/rules and knowing it was time to walk away... forever? From the classic Classics Studios, to the world changing legacy of 5 Arlington, to the legendary Dan Burke, to the endless beefs of The Deadly Snakes: THIS IS NOT TO BE MISSED!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can hear Turned Out a Punk wherever you get your podcasts, with links to every possible listening vector available at Audioboom. The &quot;I Think I Might Be Weird&quot; video also again finds the band working with <a href="https://colinmedley.com/" class="" target=_blank>Colin Medley</a>, who serves as a producer and editor.

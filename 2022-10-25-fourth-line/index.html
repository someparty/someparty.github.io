Titled <em>Five Roses</em>, the forthcoming five-song set finds the group recording with producer Peter Edwards (<a href="https://indica.mu/" class="" target=_blank>Indica Records</a>) at Studio Plateau. Look for it on November 18.</p><p>While it&#39;s been seven years since The Nils issued anything new - a wealth of cool archival material surfaced in the interregnum. In 2020, <a href="https://labelobscura.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Label Obscura</a> lavishly reissued the band&#39;s 1987 album (the self-titled set featuring the classic &quot;River of Sadness&quot;), making it officially available for the first time in decades. A 1988 radio session from CBC&#39;s <a href="https://cbcbravenewwaves.bandcamp.com/album/the-nils" class="" target=_blank>Brave New Waves</a> landed on vinyl a few years ago, further documenting the band&#39;s early heights. In April of this year, a 1992 performance at Montreal&#39;s Foufounes Electriques also surfaced as a digital release.</p><p>Alex and Carlos Soria formed The Nils in 1978 when the former was only 12 years old. Considered among the country&#39;s earliest punk groups, the group issued the <em>Sell Out Young!</em> EP in 1985 and the <em>Paisley</em> set shortly thereafter. Their first LP arrived two years later through Rock Hotel Records (an imprint of NYC hip-hop label Profile) - only for the band to wind up mired in contractual limbo following Profile&#39;s bankruptcy. The group played on and off in the years since their bumpy start, seemingly ending in tragedy when Alex took his own life in 2004. Carlos would reform the band a decade after his brother&#39;s death, taking over vocal duties and issuing the <em>Shadows and Ghosts</em> album in 2015.</p><p>The brothers share a writing credit on &quot;Fourth Line.&quot;</p><p>The band plans to celebrate the new release with a November 18 show in Toronto, playing with The Lemonheads&#39; when their <em>It&#39;s a Shame About Ray</em> tour hits the Phoenix.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3650781734/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://thenilsmtl.bandcamp.com/track/fourth-line">Fourth Line by The Nils</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=losers><span class=artist-title><a href="https://biglosers.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Losers</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;It&#39;s What You Do&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://biglosers.bandcamp.com/track/its-what-you-do" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto punk trio <a href="https://biglosers.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Losers</a> are back in action, picking up the pieces of their interrupted career with &quot;It&#39;s What You Do,&quot; the bruising first single from their forthcoming sophomore full-length. There&#39;s no detail on that record to share yet, but it follows up on the band&#39;s 2019 debut, <em>Welcome to Hell</em>.

You can preview the twelve-song set now with the tracks &quot;Shivers,&quot; &quot;Ludo,&quot; add &quot;Stargazer&quot; - all available at Bandcamp. Boasting shades of Blondie and the New Pornographers, the album arrives November 18. Lorrie Matheson (Art Bergmann, Ghostkeeper) produced and mixed the record.</p><p>Self-Cut Bands emerged during the pandemic from songwriting couple Cayley O&#39;Neill (<a href="https://darktimemusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Dark Time</a>) and Shawn Petsche (<a href="https://napalmpom.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Napalmpom</a>). This record, like their self-titled 2020 debut, found the pair recording from home, but the project&#39;s since expanded into a full live band featuring drummer Joel Nye (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Little_Rocket" class="" target=_blank>Hot Little Rocket</a>, <a href="https://nightcommittee.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Night Committee</a>), guitarist Dillon Whitfield (<a href="https://astralswans.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Astral Swans</a>, Reuben &amp; The Dark), and bassist Nicola Cavanagh (<a href="https://cardiograms.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Cardiograms</a>, Night Committee).</p><p>In a press release, the band commented on their approach this time out:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Following the surprise success of their debut self-titled album&#39;s release in late 2020, the band set to work on the follow-up with a new approach. Eschewing the escapist themes and time limited recording process of the first, the pair instead hunkered down during the pandemic and amassed a collection of over 200 musical ideas on their voice memos. Circle Around The Free represents the realization of the best of those ideas; a rock &amp; roll record with a broader palette of influences (Flashing Lights, Sloan, ABBA, The Soundtrack Of Our Lives, Sweeping Promises, The Breeders, Guerilla Toss, etc.) and a more personal and reflective reaction to the strangest of times and much personal change. A retro future rock &amp; roll statement powered by a cotton candy jet engine.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A &quot;Shivers&quot; video directed by Shawn Petsche casts the group as the protagonists in a Japanese-styled RPG. If you&#39;ve ever yearned to see the streets of Calgary reimagined in the style of Final Fantasy, now&#39;s your chance. Make sure to stay around for the stinger.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NYK_Z54IbIk" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=golden_shitters><span class=artist-title><a href="https://goldenshitters.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Golden Shitters</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Golden Shitters</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://goldenshitters.bandcamp.com/album/golden-shitters-ep" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Billed as &quot;moronic three-piece punk rock from the City of Doom,&quot; <a href="https://goldenshitters.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Golden Shitters</a> assembles a team of Hamilton punk lifers.

That&#39;s probably for the best. The group, a long-running collaboration between Blair Colwell and Skyler Cafferata, kicked off their new era with an aggressively bonkers new single dubbed &quot;George Thorogood.&quot; They comment:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;After 10 years in the making, we&#39;ve set our sights on global expansion, innovative musical collabs, and a live show that is even more refined and unhinged. Expect to be pleasantly annoyed and excited by a louder, weirder, and wilder duo that forever lurks in plain sight.</p><p>We&#39;re back with our new single, &quot;George Thorogood.&quot; Why&#39;s it called &quot;George Thorogood?&quot; Cause we&#39;re all George Thorogood... George is a good old rocker dude who wrote songs about rocking out so we figured he&#39;s a fitting subject. It&#39;s about embracing your inner George and saying to yourself &#39;heck ya, I rock!&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A video for the track, directed by Colwell and Dylan Evans of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7EsvaiyBPBaMR687W3wCg" class="" target=_blank>EYECATCHER</a>, indeed features a great many George Thorogoods.

In a post on Instagram, Duguay disclosed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I wrote Saint Maybe on a borrowed guitar in the rehab centre where I got clean from drugs and alcohol. The song was inspired by a moment shared between my mom and I in the parking lot of the centre as she delivered me for my intake, both of us desperately hoping that this time something would stick and I might become well (I did). At that same moment, my twin sister was eloping on Canada&#39;s east coast and I was left considering how different our lives looked in that instance; not comparing or taking tally, but in awe of the disparate and circuitous routes emanating from our identical upbringing. Saint Maybe is about the ways in which we can be canonized and villainized within our families of origin, about mine and my dear sister&#39;s unbreakable bond and sworn pact to end cycles of harm and neglect, and is a testament to my family&#39;s unconditional love and support. It&#39;s about desiring to make change, not knowing how, and finding examples.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track arrived alongside a video directed by Josh Lyon.</p><p>You can find Duguay on stage next in St. John&#39;s, Newfoundland.

The band&#39;s Lee Rose gave some background on the track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Desiring You&#39; was written while I was staying alone in a cabin in northern Ontario for 2 weeks. It was my first time taking a completely solo trip. Having no one for company but my dog and my instruments, I recorded the demo, staying up late into the night writing and re-writing the lyrics and harmonies, and playing the bridge riff over and over again until it felt like a second skin. I always know when a song is going to become bigger than me when I feel it in my body.</p><p>The song was inspired by a toxic relationship and the addictive and sometimes destructive nature of desiring what is not good for me. I was trying to put music to the feeling of being completely un-seen by the person I most desired being with. The song explores the tension, the anger and my ultimate refusal to be strung along.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band worked with Ian Blurton on the recording. Ace of Wants finds Rose on guitar, violin, and synth-bass foot pedals, backed by guitarist Anna Mernieks and drummer Jody Brumell. Both Rose and Brumell play with Ron Hawkins as members of the Do Good Assassins.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3381646475/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://aceofwands.bandcamp.com/track/desiring-you">Desiring You by Ace of Wands</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=tj_felix><span class=artist-title><a href="https://tjfelix.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>TJ Felix</a></span><span class=media-title><em>The Things an Injun&#39;s Gotta Do to Survive on Stolen Land</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://tjfelix.bandcamp.com/album/the-things-an-injuns-gotta-do-to-survive-on-stolen-land" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>It&#39;s been a busy month for Vancouver-based Secwépemc punk artist <a href="https://tjfelix.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>TJ Felix</a>.

The album features the lineup that debuted on 2021&#39;s <em>Uncommonwealth</em> EP, featuring vocalist Billy Hopeless reunited with guitarists Rich Jones and Jay Millette - now joined by bassist Josh Kerns (The Age Of Electric) and drummer Danni Action (Midnight Towers).</p><p>In a statement, Jones commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Reuniting with Billy and Jay for this new album brought my focus back to writing with a mindset that was pure, uncompromising Halos - as far as I&#39;m concerned we&#39;ve really achieved it. Having our friends John and Danni on board makes this feel like the strongest lineup that we&#39;ve ever had and you can really hear it on this record. Additionally, Billy and I had always planned to call the third album <em>How The Darkness Doubled</em>. So it seemed natural to use that title now, 20 years later, for what I consider to be a spiritual follow-up to <em>The Violent Years</em>.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Issued in 2001 on Sub Pop, the Jack Endino-produced <em>The Violent Years</em> earned the band something of a minor radio hit in Canada with the single &quot;Some Things Never Fall.&quot; It was followed in 2005 by <em>Alive Without Control</em>, an album without Jones&#39; participation (likely why the Television-referencing title stayed on the shelf).</p><p>Jones produced the new album alongside Dave Draper (The Wildhearts, The Professionals), with the band recording at various locations in Vancouver, Hamilton, and Brampton, Ontario. You can see a video for the lead single &quot;Tenement Kids&quot; on YouTube now, directed by Michael Crusty.</p><p><em>Uncommonwealth</em> arrived in 2021 through <a href="https://www.cursedblessingsrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Cursed Blessings Records</a>. It served as the band&#39;s first collection of new music since 2008&#39;s <em>We Are Not Alone</em>. A couple of singles surfaced on <a href="http://yeahrightrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Yeah Right</a> in the years between), notably the <em>...Ain&#39;t No Good Time To Say Goodbye</em> tribute to the late Mr. Chi Pig of <a href="http://snfu.ca/" class="" target=_blank>SNFU</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GIIXM86ldug" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2022-11-05-one-day/" rel=next title="Next article: One Day"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>One Day</div> <div class=pagination-date>November 5, 2022</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2022-10-07-all-the-queens-men/" rel=prev title="Previous article: All The Queen&#x27;s Men"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>All The Queen's Men</div> <div class=pagination-date>October 7, 2022</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

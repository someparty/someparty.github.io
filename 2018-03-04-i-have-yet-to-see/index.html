The collection includes scrappy lo-fi indie rock from <a href="https://triplesband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Triples</a>, dissonant post-hardcore from <a href="https://humanities.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Humanities</a>, some authentic pre-revival screamo from <a href="https://stresser.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stresser</a>, twangy slowcore from <a href="http://chrisrock.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chris</a> (former members of Animal Faces and La Luna), and some contemplative post-hardcore from label-owners <a href="https://low--sun.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Low Sun</a>. The whole set&#39;s available digitally at <a href="https://artoftheuncarvedblock.bandcamp.com/album/winter-compilation-2018" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> as a pay-what-you-want download. A cassette release was made available at a <a href="https://www.duplication.ca/dupeshop/" class="" target=_blank>Dupe Shop</a> show on Saturday.</p><p>Art of the Uncarved Block is run by brothers Peter and Rob Johnson, who before Low Sun had a run as <a href="https://shahman.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Shahman</a>. They laid out their rationale for this compilation series (and their label) in a few statements I shared at Punknews last week:</p><blockquote><p>The compilation is part of a new seasonal series (summer/winter) that the label will offer in order to both promote and celebrate releases from the past six months or so. Peter and I grew up discovering bands through our favourite labels compilations. We fondly recall discovering our new favourite bands and becoming obsessed with entire discographies simply by stumbling upon a single song. It felt like winning some sort of sonic lottery. Hopefully we can do the same for other potential listeners while also promoting the excitement and mysticism found in physical releases; a format that is arguably less celebrated in today’s digitally focused world.</p><p>The main goals of the label are too archive, curate, and organize. We come from a DIY scene that is both rich in diversity and immense talent. We wanted to create a home for the scene to rally behind, to gain strength and visibility through numbers. The label is very much a passion project for Peter and I, we are admirers of once small DIY labels such as Merge and Dischord records, drawing endless inspiration from their stories and histories. These are labels that put art and music before everything else and their ethics and passion to archive their scenes is extremely influential. Overall, we believe music to be a sacred form of expression and the physical format an important part of the experience and ritual. Running a label in this age requires both creativity and the understanding that a balance between these ideals and new forms of experiencing music are important in order to flourish. What can we say? We’re doing the best we can...</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2730130886/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://artoftheuncarvedblock.bandcamp.com/album/winter-compilation-2018">Winter Compilation 2018 by Art of the Uncarved Block</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://artoftheuncarvedblock.bandcamp.com/album/winter-compilation-2018" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Art of the Uncarved Block - <em>Winter Compilation 2018</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>One of the bands from outside Toronto on the comp is Winnipeg&#39;s <a href="https://1971canada.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>1971</a>, a group who saw their career cut short last year with the unexpected death of their founding bassist Cameron Glen Cranston. Last fall the surviving members of the band collected their discography on an Art of the Uncarved Block release titled <em>No Matter Where You Go, There You Are.</em></p><p>1971 members Garrett Iverson and Jory Strachan recently launched their new project, a band called <a href="https://rustowl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>R U S T O W L</a>. Following a brief stint as a two-piece, the new group&#39;s solidified with Iverson on guitar and Strachan drumming, along with bassist Robert Reimer, and Jensen Fridfinnson playing the electric organ and the fiddle. All four members share vocal credits. R U S T O W L not only flagrantly ignores my moratorium on stylized band names, but they also manage to find a cool middle ground between 1971&#39;s post-punk vibe and some Americana influences.</p><p>This week the band premiered the song &quot;Hibernation&quot; at <a href="http://www.themanitoban.com/2018/03/song-premiere-r-u-s-t-o-w-l-hibernation/33970/" class="" target=_blank>The Manitoban</a>.

Grey&#39;s could get super weird from here on out. Between Golden Drag and bassist <a href="https://crgillespie.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>C.R.

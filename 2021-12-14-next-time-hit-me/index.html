While we had no training and only the thinnest understanding of the responsibilities involved, we liked to fancy ourselves actual journalists. In practice, we&#39;d ruminate behind the scenes about coverage standards that could set us apart from the gossipy LiveJournals of the world. One of those guidelines was to only talk about upcoming media in our main news feed. A newly unveiled song or video was newsworthy. A readily available record was not. I&#39;m not sure what this rule accomplished in reality, but in principle, it kept us from editorializing on behalf of our favourites without some narrative thrust justifying the story. Please don&#39;t overthink this, as it&#39;s full of holes - but the habit remains. To this day, I reflexively delete press releases proclaiming <em>Record X is out now!</em>, because that&#39;s <em>not news</em> by the Punknews standard - and that&#39;s likely a problem.</p><p>Now Patrick McEachnie&#39;s hardly sending out dorky press releases, but he did shoot me a nice personal reminder that <a href="https://packratpunk.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Pack Rat</a>&#39;s debut LP <em>Glad To Be Forgotten</em> was finally available. Falling immediately into 20 years of Punknews ritual, I found myself scratching for <em>the story</em>. I do this despite designing Some Party to intentionally short circuit the daily news grind. If anything, fewer people care about my bullshit objectivity these days than at any point in my adult life. So why do I still need two paragraphs of rambling navel-gazing to feel comfortable saying...</p><p>Hey everyone! Pack Rat&#39;s <em>Glad To Be Forgotten</em> is out, and it&#39;s fucking killer! Get on it!</p><p>Pat McEachnie drums in Vancouver&#39;s relentless <a href="https://chainwhip.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chain Whip</a> and fronted the punk traditionalists <a href="https://cornerboys.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Corner Boys</a> before the pandemic. The latter released their sole full-length in early 2019, innocent at the time as to how sickly ironic <em>Waiting For 2020</em>&#39;s title would later seem. During the COVID doldrums, Pat taught himself guitar, home production, and (perhaps most importantly) tapped into a well of manic, frustrated energy. Corner Boys were too nice to ever write a song as frantic as &quot;Next Time Hit Me.&quot; You don&#39;t arrive at that point without suffering first. With <a href="https://hoseheadrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hosehead Records</a> on his resume, Pat&#39;ll probably never shed his reputation as an endearingly nerdy punk rock historian, but Pack Rat&#39;s anything but academic. It&#39;s the sound of an artist bouncing wildly off the walls because the world truly and thoroughly <em>sucks</em> in a way we&#39;ve never imagined. You can&#39;t fake that.</p><p><em>Glad To Be Forgotten</em> arrived with ten stir-crazy songs via the UK label <a href="http://www.drunkensailorrecords.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>Drunken Sailor Records</a>. McEachnie wrote, performed, and recorded everything you hear, perhaps by necessity, with Braden DeCorby stepping in at the end to mix and master. I do suggest giving it a spin before the year&#39;s out. Paired with Chain Whip&#39;s <em>Two Step to Hell</em> the two records make one hell of a statement.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1486720404/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://packratpunk.bandcamp.com/album/glad-to-be-forgotten">Glad To Be Forgotten by Pack Rat</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=mr_power><span class=artist-title><a href="https://mrpower.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mr. Power</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Fix It&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/5U9iv422q2g" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://mrpower.bandcamp.com/album/romance" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Mikey Power of Ottawa surf-punks <a href="https://thethrillthethrill.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Thrill</a> has a new video out spotlighting &quot;Fix It,&quot; a track from the askew-pop solo EP he released this summer as <a href="https://mrpower.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mr. Power</a>.

The latest arrived this week, and here&#39;s what frontman Murray (The Cretin) Action had to say regarding &quot;World of Hate&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;You might not realize it listening to this album, but I have learned how to process my anger as it happens. I don&#39;t hold on to it. I am not interested in revenge when I&#39;ve been wronged because You need to keep the anger alive for that. I just want to let it go. Because when it&#39;s gone there is no residual poison lurking in my subconscious waiting to transform into real hatred. Hatred can also be spawned by fear and sure, there&#39;s lot&#39;s of things I&#39;m afraid of but again, as long as I process it, I can get beyond it. What&#39;s my secret you ask? I write music. I make songs that ridicule the things I am afraid of, and the things that fuck me around. It works really good, I have a pile of self therapy songs, and I write new ones all the time. You should try it. It&#39;s really important if you want to be healthy and happy, you gotta loose the hatred. Don&#39;t even say the word.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This track features Murray on vocals and guitar, backed by guitarist/bassist Matt Fiorito and drummer Blind Marc. Terry Palohek and the aforementioned Rob Lawless engineered at The Physics Lab, with Terry Palohek mastering. The new record follows up on 2016&#39;s full-length <em>Armageddon Survival Guide</em> and a wide swash of material shared online during the pandemic. It also comes on the heels of <em>Wake Up It&#39;s Time To Die</em>, a previously unreleased 1982 session issued in 2019 on the Victoria archival label <a href="https://supremeecho.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Supreme Echo</a>.</p><p>If you&#39;re down for a few sordid stories from the Dayglo trenches, Action appeared on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/punktillidie77/" class="" target=_blank>Punk Till I Die</a> podcast earlier this year.

Wolfrik features vocalist Dylan Toews, guitarists Nathaniel Court and Mark Seifeddine, bassist Luca Properzi and drummer Nathan Troock.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4134676368/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=3025923859/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://thousandislandsrecords.bandcamp.com/album/clones">Clones by Wolfrik</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=fucked_up><span class=artist-title><a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Year of the Horse&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/USzO1yJRti4" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://fuckedup.bandcamp.com/album/year-of-the-horse" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a>&#39;s treated their massive zodiac single <em>Year of the Horse</em> to a new video that&#39;s somehow both epic in scope but rather charmingly homespun.

Given the narrative structures intrinsic to this particular piece of music (<em>Horse</em> came packaged with an actual <a href="https://we.tl/t-sg3Sgbubri" class="" target=_blank>libretto</a>), there are perhaps few songs better suited for a lavish companion video, punk or otherwise.</p><p><em>Year of the Horse</em> recently received its long-awaited vinyl treatment through <a href="https://www.tankcrimes.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tankcrimes</a>, arriving in the physical realm just as the band gears up to start celebrating the 10th anniversary of their <em>David Comes To Life</em> LP. Next year, that record will see a reissue from <a href="https://www.matadorrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Matador Records</a> (paired, of course, with full-album shows). The band also has a b-sides collection of <em>David</em>-era songs on the way, titled <em>Do All Words Can Do</em>. That set lands on March 25.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/USzO1yJRti4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=hellbent><span class=artist-title><a href="https://hellbentband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hellbent</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;GUNUNDRUM&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/jQqGGgFnbjA" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Hamilton hardcore group <a href="https://hellbentband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hellbent</a> has another new song online from their forthcoming Scott Middleton-produced LP. &quot;GUNUNDRUM&quot; lands as our second recent preview of <em>Primitive Hits</em> following the single &quot;Buckley&quot; in October.

The eclectic <a href="https://westelaken.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Westelaken</a> returns this month to further explore that elusive sound, with their new full-length <em>I Am Steaming Mushrooms</em> due May 26. You can now preview two tracks from the album: the uptempo alt-country number &quot;Fixed Up By Orange Light&quot; and the weird-folk lead single &quot;Pear Tree.&quot;</p><p>The latter features Jordan Seccareccia on guitar and vocals, Alex Baigent on bass, Rob McLay on drums, and Lucas Temor on piano. The band recorded with returning producer Paul Vroom (of <a href="https://littlekid.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Little Kid</a>) at London, Ontario&#39;s Sugar Shack, with piano tracked separately at the Tranzac in TO. You can check out an accompanying video as well from director Devin Shears. On the tune, Jordan revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Pear Tree&#39; was written in 2019. It&#39;s a song about a body, found on a beach, and the questions and conclusions people draw from bodies. Most of the questions aren&#39;t resolved and the characters in the song argue as they circle around understanding. Finding comfort with uncertainty is a theme that runs through the album. There&#39;s a musical emphasis on the space between players, listening to the hesitation and commitment between notes. Everything is measured and slow and quiet so that the tape can pick up that sweet silence and hold it in the mix. I wanted to find that weird comfort, that bleary eyed early feeling when the day is a hazy mystery, the weathered and windswept quiet as the late afternoon begins to dim and chill.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The lively &quot;Fixed Up By Orange Light&quot; arrived this week alongside a <a href="https://youtu.be/xb-7PQXaizc" class="" target=_blank>performance video</a> shot at the Toronto bookstore <a href="http://www.sellersandnewel.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sellers and Newel</a>. On that track, the band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Something we wanted to do with Paul on this album that we knew he was good at but didn&#39;t really get to fully exploit on the last album was to record as much of it live off the floor as possible. The songs on this album all create a lot of space, they breathe, and the players all stretch their legs as they go. It&#39;s not really an album of &#39;parts&#39; but of &#39;playing&#39; if that makes sense. To me it&#39;s a real benefit if you can hear the space in the room between the players in the live take, especially with songs like these. &#39;Orange Light&#39; was the hardest song to record like this because it&#39;s full of little tricks and twists and is relatively uptempo. We did take after take to try to get the right tempo, the right feel between us, good solos, fun little fills and stuff. Paul is so good at keeping things engaging and focused and honing in on the sound we&#39;re all looking for.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The recording features guest contributions from Rachael Cardiello on viola, Rachel Bellone on vocals, and Little Kid&#39;s Kenny Boothby on &quot;some batshit noisy guitar stuff.&quot;</p><p>Westelaken would have fit right in on the old Three Gut Records label, and it&#39;s easy to hear the lineage of scrappy Ontario roots/indie acts like Royal City and Cuff The Duke in the ramshackle sounds they&#39;ve assembled here. The group plans to celebrate the album release with a May 26 show at the <a href="https://www.tranzac.org/" class="" target=_blank>Tranzac</a> with Little Kid and <a href="https://onlygodforgivesto.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Only God Forgives</a> supporting. The new record follows Westelaken&#39;s 2020 full-length <em>The Golden Days Are Hard</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K2oi8F8zpks" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=woolworm><span class=artist-title><a href="https://woolworm.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Woolworm</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Bangs&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://woolworm.bandcamp.com/album/bangs" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>The oft-grim Vancouver indie rock act <a href="https://woolworm.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Woolworm</a> made a welcome return last month, teasing their fourth full-length while issuing the new single &quot;Bangs.&quot; The track, one of two recently crafted one-offs, finds the long-running group working with Nick Short of <a href="https://dumbband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dumb</a> at Choms Studio. A second track, &quot;Ritual Pass,&quot; is due in a few weeks. In a press release, Giles Roy describes &quot;Bangs&quot; as a love song, commenting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;A vocal melody fell into place naturally over a riff within minutes of its composition and, as is the case with every Woolworm song, Heather Black&#39;s backing vocals then took it to a new plane of existence. The goal was to reimagine My Bloody Valentine&#39;s Isn&#39;t Anything sound as something a little more forceful and clear. Appropriately, like the love that inspired it, the song showed up suddenly and fully formed.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track also debuts the group&#39;s revamped lineup. Since we last heard from Woolworm, longtime drummer Nick Tolliday and guitarist Alex Pomeroy each departed to follow loved ones far from the band&#39;s orbit (relocating to Toronto and England, respectively). Their shoes are filled here by drummer Graeme Macdonald, formerly of grunge rockers <a href="http://dead-soft.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dead Soft</a>, and guitarist TJ Reynolds, currently of the Vancouver hardcore group <a href="https://punitivedamage.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Punitive Damage</a>.</p><p>Woolworm last issued <em>Awe</em> in the fall of 2019 through <a href="https://www.mintrecs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mint Records</a>.

If you sneak over to <a href="https://newnoisemagazine.com/premieres/track-premiere-imploders-call-your-bluff/" class="" target=_blank>New Noise Magazine</a>, you can preview the breakneck &quot;Call Your Bluff,&quot; one of 16 songs packed onto the self-titled set. Speaking to the website, the band revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is the last song we wrote that squeaked onto the album. It&#39;s about the breaking moment when you can no longer take gilded deceit from someone, whether it be in the form of endless bullshit, vexing hype, or obvious blame shifting and denial. Overall, it falls in line with the theme of a lot of our other songs regarding the sheer frustration and stupidity of people, things, or ourselves.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Imploders congealed during the pandemic, brimming with pent-up grievances and the influence of early Californian hardcore. The band features Todd Faux (ex-<a href="https://averagetimes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Average Times</a>) on vocals, Joey Parenteau (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/viciouscyclesudbury/" class="" target=_blank>Vicious Cycle</a>, <a href="https://ilikepinkwine.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pink Wine</a>) on guitar, Mikey Microwave (<a href="https://firstbase.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>First Base</a>, <a href="https://teenarcher.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Teen Archer</a>) on bass, and Curtis Tone (<a href="http://weareplasticheads.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>PlasticHeads</a>, <a href="https://schooldamage.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>School Damage</a>) drumming.</p><p>The new album follows the band&#39;s recent live tape, <em>EXD</em>, and their similarly self-titled 2021 EP.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2442151486/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/album/imploders-2">Imploders by Imploders</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=tough_age><span class=artist-title><a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Give It a Day&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/album/waiting-here" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Vancouver&#39;s <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a> recently shared another preview of their forthcoming album <em>Waiting Here</em> through the propulsive &quot;Give It a Day.&quot; <a href="https://bobointegral.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bobo Integral</a>&#39;s write-up reiterates some of the band&#39;s key influences, calling it &quot;another perfect mix of The Feelies, sped up R.E.M. and all Flying Nun kiwi pop.&quot; What more could you want?</p><p>In a brief statement, guitarist/vocalist Jarrett Evan Samson cited the emotional upheaval of Penny Clark&#39;s retirement, referring to &quot;Give it a Day&quot; as:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;A song about not giving up despite having every reason to, inspired by Penny leaving the band and...other things, reflecting on everything working against me all this time including myself&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While Samson and Clark remain partners off-stage, the bassist/vocalist stepped back from an active role in the group with the conclusion of their Toronto residency.</p><p><em>Waiting Here</em> lands June 16 through Spain&#39;s <a href="https://bobointegral.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bobo Integral</a> and the Chandra-band affiliated <a href="https://wearetime.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>We Are Time</a>.

We sent the jam over to Tom Fec (Tobacco) and he picked out his favorite moments. We used those parts to block out the song structure and some scratch vocals. Then Tom added a bunch of lead synth lines on top with a Juno. After that was mostly just polishing the track up until both parties were happy with it&quot;</p></blockquote><p>New York noise artist <a href="https://dreamcrusher.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Dreamcrusher</a> created the artwork for the <em>ICON</em> project.

As a queer-identifying band from the Filipino diaspora, the group presents a sound and perspective that feels utterly unique in the Canadian music landscape. As on their Polaris-shortlisted 2020 debut, Pantayo&#39;s blazing new trails through the combination of Western indie staples and the kulintang, a percussive instrument indigenous to the southern Philippine islands of Mindanao. You can hear the 8-song album&#39;s first single, &quot;One More Latch (Give It To &#39;Ya),&quot; online now, or see it visualized on YouTube in a piece by Omar Rivero (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/driftnote/" class="" target=_blank>Driftnote</a>) with art by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/em.esquivel/" class="" target=_blank>Em Esquivel</a>.</p><p>The band enlisted Toronto filmmaker <a href="https://www.triciahagoriles.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tricia Hagoriles</a> to comment on the new single:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;With the visceral use of only gongs, drums and vocals, One More Latch (Give It To &#39;Ya) feels like an homage to women musicians in the 90s that wrote or performed songs about their own sexual desires (ie. TLC&#39;s Creep and Janet Jackson&#39;s That&#39;s the Way Love Goes). Which, for an all-women Filipina band near-explicitly, expressing sexual desire, is a point of subversion in itself.</p><p>Overt sexualization and fetishization that is grounded in white supremacist, racist, sexist, and classist objectification has always had a taxing effect on Asian women. For Filipinas in Canada and other diasporic communities, the experience trickles into their daily lives in specific ways; gendered marginalization due to labor (ie. caregiving), occupying the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder, hypervisibility in occupations such as nurse or nanny, and mail order brides in the 1980s. And when you consider Queer spaces, the Filipina can be rendered invisible. As objects of desire and imposed tropes under a white supremacist gaze, Filipinas are seen as powerless and disposable.</p><p>One More Latch (Give It To &#39;Ya) IS a BOP of a hookup song, but it&#39;s also a reclamation of desire. As Pantayo speaks about the writing process, the song came from an unabashedly lusty place. The song and the upcoming music video will be about owning carnal instincts, overcoming the shame of wanting and being wanted, redefining desirability and sensuality beyond a physical and one-sided realm.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Pantayo features Eirene Cloma, Michelle Cruz, Joanna Delos Reyes, Kat Estacio, and Katrina Estacio.

You can see it on YouTube.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=915218341/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://barnaclemtl.bandcamp.com/album/old-songs">Old Songs by Barnacle</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=century_palm><span class=artist-title><a href="https://centurypalm.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Century Palm</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://centurypalm.bandcamp.com/album/century-palm-play-gordon-lightfoot" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>I&#39;m ill-equipped to eulogize someone with the stature and impact of <a href="https://gordonlightfoot.com/" class="" target=_blank>Gordon Lightfoot</a>, and with a wealth of tributes flooding in from all corners, there&#39;s little new I could offer. I can confidently say I stole my parents&#39; beat-up copy of <em>Gord&#39;s Gold</em> years before my punk rock brain knew how to appreciate it. It seemed important — canonical. I wasn&#39;t wrong in that assumption if slow to realize it. My copy still has a War Amps return address sticker marring the cover; moms in the 80s stuck those on everything.</p><p>I am, however, particularly well suited to gush over <a href="https://centurypalm.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Century Palm</a>, the short-lived Toronto post-punk that brought members of <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a>, the <a href="https://ketamines.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ketamines</a>, and <a href="https://zebrassieres.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Zebrassieres</a> together to make cool new wave tunes. The band&#39;s debut arrived in early 2017, contemporaneous to the first Some Party mailings. You could say I imprinted on them, as I did many artists and festivals from this publication&#39;s early days.</p><p>Century Palm remains utterly defunct, but given the news, they&#39;ve unearthed a previously elusive cover of Lightfoot&#39;s untouchable &quot;If You Could Read My Mind.&quot; The audio, available on Bandcamp, features Paul Lawton and Alex Handlyn performing (with the latter on lead vocals). It&#39;s pretty neat, and given its sombre presentation, it feels entirely appropriate.</p><p>Rest in peace, Gord.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3265704896/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://centurypalm.bandcamp.com/album/century-palm-play-gordon-lightfoot">Century Palm Play Gordon Lightfoot by Century Palm</a></iframe> </body></html> </div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2023-05-13-human-body-human-brain/" rel=next title="Next article: Human Body Human Brain"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Human Body Human Brain</div> <div class=pagination-date>May 13, 2023</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2023-04-23-anyway/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Anyway"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Anyway</div> <div class=pagination-date>April 23, 2023</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

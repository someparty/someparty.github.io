Stuck in isolation during the worst of the crisis, Danny proved impossibly prolific - outproducing everyone at a time when artists had little to do but sit at home and mine their hard drives for Bandcamp Friday fodder. The brash Spider Bite stood out among its siblings. On vocals, we found a gleefully unrestrained <a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a>, setting aside his weathered poetry and the assumed stoicism of his elder status to rekindle the spit-and-sneer of his punk rock youth. The <a href="http://theconstantines.wordpress.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constantines</a>, of course, had their loud moments, as did Baby Eagle during the <em>Bone Soldiers</em>/<em>Dog Weather</em> era, but nobody mistook either for street punk (...and I heard about it every time I shoehorned them into Punknews.org). Spider Bite&#39;s insolent fire comes from something even earlier.</p><p>Danny&#39;s steadfast brother Ian rounds out the trio on drums. While the Romanos spent their youth in the Welland pop-punk unit <a href="https://attackinblack.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Attack In Black</a> and more recently rekindled that swagger in <a href="http://ancientshapes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ancient Shapes</a>, Ian boasts the gnarliest modern punk notch in his belt: during the <em>Machine Response</em> years he sat behind the kit for Toronto hardcore kingpins <a href="https://careersuicide.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Career Suicide</a>. All that backstory, and what I suspect is a fair helping of childhood nostalgia for Rancid (and the like), spilled onto the lockdown Internet in May of 2020 as the 10-song self-titled Spider Bite LP.</p><p>The emergency may have faded, but the world still sucks, so this summer sees the group revived. Spider Bite returns June 16 with their second LP, a 10-song set dubbed <em>The Rainbow And The Dove</em>. The band&#39;s press release comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;But still. Time passes. More wars. More storms. More ruin caused by greed. Spider Bite reconvened in the spring of 2022, recording <em>The Rainbow and The Dove</em>, an album that assembles the wisdom teachings of punk elders into a passionate rejection of settler-colonialism, environmental racism, and the general exploitation of the world by monarchs and resource extraction companies. Every moment is historical. Spider Bite celebrate a continuity of protest and refusal, and the communal joy of loud energy. Animated by a surprising humor and immense instrumental power, Spider Bite create a vibrant portrait of living in violent times.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The lead single, &quot;Human Body Human Brain,&quot; is streaming now at the usual places. If I&#39;ve not made it painfully obvious, this is peak Some Party content in every way possible.</p><p>Ian mixed the new record, with Daniel Husayn mastering at the North London Bomb Factory. The vinyl pressing on Daniel and Steven&#39;s <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> label includes the audio from their 2020 debut, 20 tracks in total. The group&#39;s also offering a limited version that comes packaged with a 42-page risographed zine, showcasing handwritten lyrics by Steve and 20 original drawings by Danny.</p><p>Steven Lambke last issued <em>Volcano Volcano</em> in April of 2022. He&#39;s on the road now in Europe supporting <a href="http://www.wearetheburninghell.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Burning Hell</a>. Daniel Romano&#39;s main band, The Outfit, last released the psychedelic rock opera <em>La Luna</em>.

The trio delivered a sound that felt almost mercifully uncomplicated, a throwback to some vibrant idealized past. I&#39;m not even sure which specific period I&#39;m alluding to (90s Lookout Records? Peak-indie rock Mint? Beats me), but after the stifling malaise of recent years, Night Court feels like an open window.</p><p>The band returns June 9 with <em>Humans!</em>, their sixteen-song third album. Despite that count and befitting the band&#39;s jittery essence, the record only clocks in at 27 minutes. Look for it in the US through <a href="https://snappylittlenumbers.bandcamp.com/album/humans" class="" target=_blank>Snappy Little Numbers</a> and here at home through <a href="https://debtoffensiverecords.bandcamp.com/album/humans" class="" target=_blank>Debt Offensive</a>. You can preview the set with the single &quot;Out Of Control,&quot; with drummer Emilor Jayne stepping up on lead vocals. The rest of the band joins in on the chorus, shouting, &quot;We don&#39;t need to be reminded of being absent-minded,&quot; like a mission statement.</p><p>Night Court features bassist/vocalist Jiffy Marx (of the BC new wavers <a href="http://autogramm.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Autogramm</a>), guitarist Dave-O (<a href="https://jiffymarker.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jiffy Marker</a>, <a href="https://bloodmeridiancanada.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Blood Meridian</a>), and drummer Emilor Jane (<a href="https://synchromantics.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Synchromantics</a>, <a href="https://petblessings.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Pet Blessings</a>).

The band has their eleven-song <em>Heavenly Sweetheart</em> lined up for cassette release through South Carolina&#39;s <a href="https://selfawarerecords.bandcamp.com/album/heavenly-sweetheart" class="" target=_blank>Self Aware Records</a>. Look for it on June 14. The news arrived alongside the charming jangle pop single &quot;Harder 2 Smile.&quot; In a press release, project lead Matty Morand revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;When I initially wrote this song I was trying to do a quiet, melodic Elliott Smith sort of thing but it&#39;s hard to teach an old dog new tricks I guess. I think that still pokes through in the guitars It&#39;s about having a bad feeling about someone who eventually proves you right.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new album&#39;s the next chapter in Matty Morand and Sam Bielanski&#39;s wonderfully reciprocal recording cycle, coming right on the heels of <a href="https://ponytheband.ca" class="" target=_blank>PONY</a>&#39;s new album <em>Velveteen</em>. With Bielanski in the captain&#39;s chair, that album arrives next week (May 19) through <a href="http://www.takethistoheartrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Take This To Heart Records</a>. <em>Heavenly Sweetheart</em> swaps Morand to lead vocals, guitar, and synth, with Bielanski moving to bass and harmonies. Christian Beale (This is Hell, Iron Chic) supports on guitar with Josh Cassidy (<a href="https://trout.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Trout</a>) drumming. The group recorded with <a href="https://psychicvoid.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Psychic Void</a>&#39;s Josh Kaiser (apart from the Brooklyn-based Beale, who tracked his parts remotely).</p><p>The new album also collects the recent digital singles &quot;Weird Year&quot; and &quot;See You Around.&quot; Pretty Matty issued their self-titled LP in 2019 through <a href="https://getbetterrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Get Better Records</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=651533103/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://prettymatty.com/album/heavenly-sweetheart">Heavenly Sweetheart by Pretty Matty</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=old><span class=artist-title><a href="https://tohc83.bandcamp.com/album/old-lp" class="" target=_blank>OLD</a></span><span class=media-title><em>OLD</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://tohc83.bandcamp.com/album/old-lp" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Brian Taylor and <a href="https://rickwhitearchive.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Rick White</a>&#39;s side-gig <a href="https://tohc83.bandcamp.com/album/old-lp" class="" target=_blank>OLD</a> returned with an 18-song self-titled LP last week. Like the duo&#39;s debut in February, it recklessly blasts through a collection of throwback hardcore, bookended by a pair of songs that directly grapple with the notion of aging out of the punk scene. You can find the set at the <a href="https://tohc83.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>TOHC83</a> Bandcamp page, the digital home of Ontario punk artifacts like the <em>T.O. Hardcore 83</em> tape and classic records from Chronic Submission and Youth Youth Youth.</p><p>Brian Taylor, best known these days from the Toronto record store <a href="https://www.rotate.com/" class="" target=_blank>Rotate This</a>, appears here on lead vocals and bass. He sang for <a href="https://tohc83.bandcamp.com/album/youth-youth-youth-anthology" class="" target=_blank>Youth Youth Youth</a> back in the early 80s. Rick White, who hardly needs an introduction given his past with the legendary <a href="https://www.subpop.com/artists/erics_trip" class="" target=_blank>Eric&#39;s Trip</a>, performs guitar and drums. The duo wrote and recorded these tracks last December.</p><p>The set follows a flurry of recent activity from White, who issued the psych-rocking <em>Where It&#39;s Fine</em> solo LP in 2021 through <a href="https://bluefogrecordings.bigcartel.com/" class="" target=_blank>Blue Fog Recordings</a>, among a slate of vinyl reissues from Elevator/Elevator to Hell and Eric&#39;s Trip.

In a statement, vocalist Chance Hutchinson addressed the contrast:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Optimizer&#39; is a direct stab at post-punk because I wasn&#39;t really impressed with a lot of the stuff I was hearing. We always dipped our toes in post-punk, but I felt it was necessary to dive in on this one. I hadn&#39;t written a song around a bass line since &#39;Brew HA HA&#39; from the last record and once I had the groove, it was really easy to see where it should go.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>PRIORS features Hutchison backed by drummer Drew Demers (<a href="https://thefamines.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Famines</a>), bassist Alan Hildebrandt (Tabarnak), and guitarists Maxime Desharnais (<a href="https://newvogue.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>New Vogue</a>) and Sebastien Godin (<a href="https://sonicavenues.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sonic Avenues</a>). The new record also features guest saxophone from Dave Forcier (<a href="https://steveadamykband.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Steve Adamyk Band</a> and Australia&#39;s <a href="https://civicivic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>CIVIC</a>). Desharnais recorded the band at Marsonic on des Carrières in Montreal, with Harris Newman (Julie Doiron, Status/Non-Status) mastering. The eight-song LP arrives through Mothland on June 2.</p><p>The new album follows the band&#39;s 2020 EP <em>NEWNEWNEW</em> and PRIORS&#39; 2021 LP <em>My Punishment on Earth</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2407598796/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://priorsmtl.bandcamp.com/album/daffodil">Daffodil by Priors</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=nora_kelly_band><span class=artist-title><a href="https://norakellyband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Nora Kelly Band</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Lay Down Girl&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/dBZWHWnS_TA" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://norakellyband.bandcamp.com/track/lay-down-girl-2" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Nora Kelly&#39;s eponymous alt-country act takes a major leap forward this summer, with <a href="https://www.mintrecs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mint Records</a> signed on to issue the quartet&#39;s debut full-length. You can now preview <em>Rodeo Clown</em> through the earworm lead single &quot;Lay Down Girl.&quot; On the track, which arrived alongside a video from director Gabie Che, Kelly commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The lyrics to this song were direct advice that I was giving to myself, to stop being a &#39;Lay Down Girl.&#39; To stop staying put, acting sweet and putting everyone else first. Other people&#39;s approval had been my priority for so long that over time my connection to what I liked and what I wanted had become weak. The lyrics are advice to this former self, with a chorus that chants, &#39;I&#39;ve been a fool... I&#39;m going back to school, but this time my education&#39;s gonna be &#39;bout myself.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A press release unpacks the impact of pandemic isolation on Kelly&#39;s worldview, including the realization that her prior artistic circles offered little support in times of trouble.

In a press release, the Montreal art-punk act comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song calls out gossip and drama that occur in friend groups. The person it is directed towards loves dancing. It&#39;s a pretty dancey song. We hope they dance to it.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band shared the track alongside a suitably frenetic homemade video. On it, guitarist Laurence Anne Charest-Gagné shared:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It all started with a glitch on the videotape. Images from the animated film Sonic intertwined with footage of us performing &#39;Serpent&#39; live. Then, the idea was to create a synchronicity between the sound and different performances captured during SXSW in Texas. An enthralling short film. Guaranteed fun.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The group recorded with Samuel Gemme engineering at Gamma Recording Studio (Corridor, Anemone). La Sécurité features Éliane Viens-Synnott on lead vocals and synth, Félix Bélisle on bass, Kenny Smith on drums, Laurence-Anne on guitar and synth, and Melissa Di Menna on the same (current and former members of Choses Sauvages, Laurence-Anne, Jesuslesfilles, Silver Dapple, DATES, and Pressure Pin).

Write longer songs? Spend money on production for a 17 second song? We did neither. In fact, we spent the exact amount that Spotify pays us per year - $3.78.</p><p>First we dressed up like bees because we have a song about bees and messed up traffic on a busy street, and then we forgot that we did that and made a rap rock looking thing on a bench.

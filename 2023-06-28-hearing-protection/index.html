The collection, the band&#39;s first on vinyl, reunites drummer Melanie Mcdonald, bassist Andrée St-Onge, and guitarist/vocalist Julie Houle. The band recorded with Mitch Houle (of <a href="https://tommyandthecommies.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Tommy and the Commies</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Statues-24116128619/" class="" target=_blank>Statues</a>) as the Piss Factory in 2022.

The clip presents the song, and its practical advice, as a high-school-set PSA. They reveal:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The song Hearing Protection was actually written about our friend Adam Responsible. He would show up at shows and hand out hearing protection. He was a huge advocate for the very real dangers of hearing loss. At Xmas, he would give the gift of earplugs.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The Ape-ettes last released a self-titled album in 2017. At the height of the pandemic, Julie, as <a href="https://juliekatrinette.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Julie Katrinette</a>, issued a full-length solo record of folk, country, and bluegrass tunes titled <em>Let&#39;s Not Complicate Things With Our Minds</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cw3Ft_j2Xcw" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=puffer><span class=artist-title><a href="https://puffpuffpuff.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Puffer</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Puffer</em> EP</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://puffpuffpuff.bandcamp.com/album/s-t-ep" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Montreal hardcore/punk act <a href="https://puffpuffpuff.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Puffer</a> has a raucous self-titled EP out through Brooklyn&#39;s <a href="https://www.imitateahuman.com/" class="" target=_blank>Roachleg Records</a>.

You can hear &quot;Go Go Giant Robo&quot; at Bandcamp now, one of three songs to appear on the <em>Outstanding Balance</em> EP (available in full on July 10). The new set collects the last songs the band wrote before their extended hiatus and the 2015 death of drummer Eric Bourque. The surviving members revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We owed you these songs. We owed them to ourselves, to be honest. Also we really wanted to go out on a pun, and on this album cover. Frankly, I think we nailed it.</p><p>We were never trying to &#39;make it.&#39; We toured, we played shows regularly, we put out records, but it was never our goal to be the biggest band ever. We wanted to play music with our friends. When we played what turned out to be our final show (which WAS actually <a href="https://bathurst.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Bathurst</a>&#39;s final show) it wasn&#39;t that we actively broke up, we just chose to hang out and be friends instead.</p><p>It wasn&#39;t easy peasy though. We pushed ourselves incredibly hard to write more songs like this, and it hit a point where it wasn&#39;t fun to do that anymore. Callum left the band, Matthew had switched to guitar, we&#39;d brought Pod from <a href="https://deforesters.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Deforesters</a> on bass, and this thing that was supposed to be &#39;four grown men giving up on being adored&#39; became laden with pressure to continue playing shows and write more complex music, both of which were kind of in violation of, you know, the whole Careers In Science experience. So we stopped. Never really announced anything. Despite the efforts of Art Drug records to encourage us to sell and tour Cowards, it wasn&#39;t enjoyable to do it without each other. Then, when Eric died, any thoughts of making music like this again disappeared into the ether.</p><p>But over time we started to think that man... these might be good.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can read more on the group&#39;s struggle and their current status at Bandcamp, along with a breakdown of &quot;Go Go Giant Robo.&quot; The track features Callum McPhee on guitar, Matthew Winkler on bass, and Dave Proctor singing. While the late Eric Bourque arranged the drums for &quot;Robo,&quot; you hear Winkler behind the kit on the recording.</p><p>Look for the remainder of <em>Outstanding Balance</em> in the coming weeks.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2982280589/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://careersinscience.bandcamp.com/album/outstanding-balance">Outstanding Balance by Careers In Science</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=private_lives><span class=artist-title><a href="https://privatelivesmtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Private Lives</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Hit Record</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://privatelivesmtl.bandcamp.com/album/hit-record" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://privatelivesmtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Private Lives</a> are readying their first LP for a June 14 release through Cincinnati&#39;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/feelitrecordshop/" class="" target=_blank>Feel It Records</a>.

As a quartet, the couple brought in bassist Josh Herlihey and <a href="https://thelonelyparade.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lonely Parade</a> drummer Frank Climenhage to craft a cool set of surfy post-punk tunes. Chance and Jackie&#39;s collective years fronting incredibly high-energy bands make Private Lives&#39; relative sense of restraint feel well-earned.

The album opener, &quot;The Baffling Origin,&quot; is streaming at Bandcamp now, with the remainder due June 30. As with the group&#39;s previous releases, this album finds them wrapping a warped narrative in an improvisational swirl of psychedelia, noise-punk, and high-concept absurdity. The band boasted of the &quot;mind-numbing journey&quot; they&#39;ve constructed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Mr. Neckofthewoods&#39; tells the bewildering tale of a magical decaying stump, and the great war with the evil Council of the Trees. Steffofthewoods and Zachofthewoods must unite with their strange pal, or the fate of the planet will fall into the wrong roots! The album was fully improvised and recorded atop Mount Bung in a cloud of smoke in April. It features a wide variety of eclectic sounds including electric kazoo, monotron, analog tape effects and vintage synthesizers...&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The collection&#39;s the duo&#39;s fifth release of the year, following February&#39;s faux-live album <em>Futureless Throb: Live In Japan, 1983</em>, April&#39;s <em>The Quest for the Golden Bung</em>, and the recent video performance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vobYrbscJDE" class="" target=_blank>Live?

On the tune, Reich commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I use the metaphor of having a dream or aspiration as having a virus that is contagious and infectious. You need to be excessively motivated to work on a music project, complete it and share it with the world in this day and age where artists don&#39;t really gain financially and work tirelessly. Perhaps we do it because it&#39;s part of our identity, it&#39;s in our spirit, and we are the ideas of tomorrow. There&#39;s something infectious about having a vision and seeing it through even with little gain. It&#39;s still a beautiful thing.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track arrives alongside a trippy animated clip by Jonathan Carroll of <a href="http://spek.work/" class="" target=_blank>SpekWork Studio</a>.</p><p>Reich co-produced <em>Living on the Edge</em> with Josh Korody (Beliefs, Breeze), who also mixed at Toronto&#39;s Candle Studios.

Their sole LP, <em>Curry Up</em>, first appeared in 2010 through <a href="https://www.nortonrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Norton Records</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1552128761/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://khannibalism.bandcamp.com/album/hungama-khamoshi">Hungama &amp; Khamoshi by Tandoori Knights (feat.

The nine-track <em>Croak in the Weeds</em> is due on October 11 from <a href="https://www.telephoneexplosion.com/" class="" target=_blank>Telephone Explosion</a>, the second in a planned trilogy that started with 2017&#39;s <em>Under Grape Leaves</em>. Like that record, the new material presents a relaxed, minimalist counterpoint to the raucous noise of the Snakes&#39; era. Ethier&#39;s sly sense of humour still seems to hover on the periphery, but it&#39;s a slight wink - never falling into the acerbic sass of his former band.</p><p>You can space out to the low-key single &quot;Dream On Pigs&quot; though the Eva Michon-directed, canine-starring video below. You&#39;ll note some birdsong in the mix, which suggests the new album will carry forward some of the soothing nature motifs established on <em>Grape Leaves</em>. In a press release, Ethier&#39;s comments on the record seem similarly rooted:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I was imagining a pond at the swamp. A pond gets murkier the deeper you dive. Frogs are amphibians. They&#39;re in and out of the pond like it&#39;s no big deal, but we stay mostly on the shore and only peer in. Then, when the weather is right, the pond rises in a mist and we can breathe it too. We can be in the pond but also on the shore.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Ethier recorded the new album in his Toronto studio with producer <a href="http://www.sandroperri.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sandro Perri</a>. Perri, a celebrated ambient and post-rock artist in his own right, previously worked with Ethier on <em>Grape Leaves</em>. Between that record and this, Ethier appeared as a guest vocalist on Perri&#39;s 2018 effort <em>In Another Life</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bj-_-Fxi8Xw" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Bj-_-Fxi8Xw" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: André Ethier - &quot;Dream on Pigs&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Earlier in the summer, we learned that Montreal post-punk group <a href="https://corridormtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Corridor</a> would become the first francophone band signed to the Seattle&#39;s legendary <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a>. There was no new music to share at the time, but details have since come to light. We can now look forward to the 10-track full-length <em>Junior</em>, arriving this fall. The record&#39;s set to arrive on October 18, with <a href="https://www.bonsound.com" class="" target=_blank>Bonsound</a> covering the release in Canada.</p><p>You can preview Corridor&#39;s new single &quot;Topographe&quot; in a wild new video directed by the band&#39;s Jonathan Robert. He had this to say about the clip, which should instantly call to mind Terry Gilliam&#39;s classic animated segments from Monty Python:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;While I&#39;ve explored and mixed many different techniques in my past music videos, it&#39;s the first time that I took the process this far, blending all of them together in one place. It&#39;s a melting pot of stop motion, green screen, illustration, animation, collage, and live video. It&#39;s the visual equivalent of the progression of the song, a simple idea that takes amplitude through repetition.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Junior</em>, the band&#39;s third album, follows up on 2017&#39;s <em>Supermercado</em>. Emmanuel Éthier produced their new material working with engineer Samuel Gemme. Corridor features Jonathan Robert on vocals, guitar and synths, with Dominic Berthiaume on vocals and bass, Julian Perreault on guitar, and Julien Bakvis drumming.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ARlYyefSZgo" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/ARlYyefSZgo" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Corridor - &quot;Topographe&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>London punks <a href="https://redarms.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Red Arms</a> are back with <em>Critical State</em>, a new 10-song full-length and their first new material since 2016&#39;s <em>Let Every Nation Know</em>.

These sun explorers represent how when men have the abilities to do great things they inherently fuck it up and in this case, fly directly into the sun. To sum it up people are fucking dummies and we are doomed.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band recorded the single at Rock Out Farm, their rural studio nestled among the orchards of Vineland, Ontario.

Fans of the last few Flatliners records should take note of this one, as there&#39;s a similar vibe here.</p><p>In a statement singer/guitarist Kyle Wilton commented on the new effort:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The songs truly are singles; they are unique by nature. With these three tunes, the only thing we knew going into the studio was that we specifically wanted to bring something to our fans that was personal, raw, real, and altogether human. We wanted to give them a deeper look into who Excuses Excuses is, why we love what we do, and to show why we constantly fight to keep moving forward.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Excuses Excuses features guitarist/vocalist Kyle Wilton, bassist Trevor Bowman, and drummer Jason Nicoll. The new set follows the band&#39;s 2018 EP <em>Catch Me If You Can</em>.

It&#39;ll be the prolific band&#39;s fifth LP. You can preview the single &quot;Slipping Under&quot; below.</p><p>Drummer Brett Whittingham broke down the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Slipping Under is one of the more complex arrangements on the album. It starts off with a dark n&#39; dreamy clean intro, experimenting with some electronic drums, before it kicks into the heavy bridge and on to the tight n&#39; groovy verses. The pre-solo section also includes more experimentation with the inclusion of some dirty 808 drops, something we haven&#39;t tried before! This song is a blast to play live with its multitude of changes and dynamics. Mike Fraser mixed this song, along with Ghost, and his take on both tracks added a nice depth and diversity to the album as a whole.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band will hit the road this fall to support the new record alongside Edmonton&#39;s <a href="https://blackmastiff.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Black Mastiff</a>.

The clip, which features the new song &quot;Flames,&quot; serves as a prequel of sorts to the narrative established in the &quot;Sun Poisoning&quot; and &quot;The Girls I Know Don&#39;t Think So&quot; videos over the summer. Frontman Brandon Williams spoke with <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/chastity-break-the-devils-heart-in-forlorn-new-video/" class="" target=_blank>Kerrang</a> about the proliferation of visuals from the group, revealing that the videos are indeed portions of a wider work to come:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;All of these individual videos are part of a film I wrote, and it spans the record front to back. These videos are plucked from the film in order to drop singles. The premise of the film is, a young boy walks into a trailer park to trick-or-treat, and every door he knocks he enters into a new world...&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Williams comments that the film, in its completed form, should be available in the spring and could lend itself to some unique performance pieces down the road.</p><p><em>Home Made Satan</em> arrives on September 13 from <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a> and <a href="http://www.capturedtracks.com/" class="" target=_blank>Captured Tracks</a>. It follows the band&#39;s 2018 debut <em>Death Lust</em> and the subsequent outtake-collecting EP <em>Death Lust Cuts</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0fU9sHycvs" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/L0fU9sHycvs" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Chastity - &quot;Flames&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto punk/hard rock act <a href="https://theanti-queens.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Anti-Queens</a> have a new video online featuring their single &quot;Worse Than Death.&quot; The song&#39;s slated to appear on the band&#39;s 11-track, self-titled <a href="https://stomprecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stomp Records</a> debut on September 13.</p><p>The Anti-Queens features Emily Bones on lead vocals and guitar, Valerie Knox (of Oshawa&#39;s <a href="https://blackcatattack.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Black Cat Attack</a>) on guitar and vocals, Dallas Conte on drums, and Taylor Cos (of Newmarket&#39;s <a href="https://ruebella.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Rue Bella</a>) on bass and vocals.</p><p>The Anti-Queens will play a handful of record-release shows in Montreal, Jonquière, Quebec City, and Toronto over the next month before heading to Europe for a tour with labelmates <a href="https://thecreepshow.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Creepshow</a>.

Look for a new song each week now until then - with the album-opener &quot;Misadventure&quot; leading the pack (and &quot;The Pest&quot; surfacing as I edit this week&#39;s mailout...). The track finds frontman Noel Macdonald again delivering his distinctive vocal performance - channelling a snotty young Elvis Costello against a loving pastiche of new wave and college rock sounds. Here Macdonald (earlier of <a href="http://moonhalifax.tumblr.com" class="" target=_blank>Moon</a>) tackles guitar, vocals, and keys, backed by <a href="https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Booji Boys</a> drummer Justin Crowe and <a href="http://hungryrecords.bandcamp.com/album/shorelines" class="" target=_blank>Working Titles</a>&#39; Glen Leck on bass. While this is the lineup&#39;s first full-length together, the same personnel previously issued a pair of one-off digital singles back in 2020 (&quot;Half a Battle&quot; and &quot;Isle of Isosceles&quot;).</p><p>The trio recorded in Leck&#39;s basement, where Macdonald ran the rhythm section through minimal rehearsals before setting their performance to tape. With those somewhat improvisational takes in hand, he retreated to his home studio to mix and track overdubs. He reflects on the shoestring process in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I wanted to make us sound like the albums from the &#39;80s that I love. The problem is that they sound incredible because they&#39;re so well recorded. You can&#39;t really make an album like [Tears for Fears]&#39; <em>Songs From The Big Chair</em> on a bedroom budget, but that&#39;s always the yardstick.&quot;&#39;</p></blockquote><p>The album presents an exploration of grief, spurred initially by the death of a pet but certainly exacerbated by the communal trauma of the pandemic. Macdonald revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;You can feel like you&#39;ve gone through every stage of grief and then be right back where you started. A lot of the problems come from trying to rush through it. You can&#39;t help but scream back at the universe sometimes when you&#39;re going through something tough and there&#39;s no divine hand involved. This album is about that, but it&#39;s also about saying goodbye to modern life as we understand it, with everything that&#39;s happened in the last two years.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new record arrives as the band&#39;s second long-player, following 2018&#39;s debut <em>Walk It Back</em>. In the years since Washing Machine appeared on a split with the Halifax shoegaze group <a href="https://valeriemusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Valerie</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1936957504/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://washingmachine.bandcamp.com/album/cheat-the-pattern">Cheat The Pattern by Washing Machine</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=mononegatives><span class=artist-title><a href="https://mononegatives.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mononegatives</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Role Reversal&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://mononegatives.bandcamp.com/album/counterclockwise-interjection" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>London synth-punks <a href="https://mononegatives.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Mononegatives</a> have a new EP out through LA design collective <a href="https://dowdrecords.com" class="" target=_blank>Dowd Records</a>. <em>Counterclockwise Interjection</em> features two new tracks: the robotic assault of &quot;Role Reversal&quot; backed by &quot;Consumer Trust&quot; (the band&#39;s favourite song, apparently). You can now hear the A-side streaming at Bandcamp, with the flip exclusive to the physical realm. The new set&#39;s their single issued through Dowd, following November&#39;s lathe cut <em>Frequencies Rotating Clockwise</em>. This time out, the band features <a href="http://robbiebrake.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Robbie Brake</a> (<a href="https://isolationparty.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Isölation Party</a>) on guitar, synth, and vocals, with drummer David Cereghini, guitarist Jon Lamont, and bassist Aaron Wallis. The new EP&#39;s available as both a 3&quot; toy vinyl and a 7&quot; maxi-single.</p><p>Dowd&#39;s (entirely justified, in my opinion) love affair with Mononegatives runs deep. Earlier, the label and gear shop issued a Monos-signature version of their Fuzz Crusher pedal, designed explicitly for synth and bass use. They&#39;ll soon host the group at several Californian showcase performances this July.</p><p>The new EP comes on the heels of a December split with Albany&#39;s <a href="https://mysterygirl518.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mystery Girl</a>. Mononegatives issued their last full-length, <em>Apparatus Division</em>, in 2020 through <a href="https://bigneckrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Big Neck</a> and <a href="https://www.nofrontteeth.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>No Front Teeth</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=66524731/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://mononegatives.bandcamp.com/album/counterclockwise-interjection">Counterclockwise Interjection by MONONEGATIVES</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=julianna_riolino><span class=artist-title><a href="https://juliannariolinosings.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Julianna Riolino</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Lone Ranger&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/V_Qqnefjglg" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://juliannariolinosings.bandcamp.com/album/all-blue" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://juliannariolinosings.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Julianna Riolino</a>&#39;s best known as a member of <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a>&#39;s band The Outfit, a role in which she&#39;s become increasingly visible. On the recent <em>Cobra Poems</em> she stepped up to sing lead on a pair of songs (notably the standout single &quot;The Motions&quot;), while at the same time her stage presence blossomed. Riolino&#39;s animated and assertive role in the group&#39;s performances is now downright essential to The Outfit&#39;s overall vibe. While her outsized role in the band feels recent, it&#39;s been a far longer road for her solo journey. I fondly recall watching intimate, rootsy JR shows back in the S.C.E.N.E. Fest days, and we haven&#39;t had one of those in nearly a decade.</p><p>Following up on a 2019 EP, Riolino&#39;s finally ready to issue a solo full-length this fall. <em>All Blue</em> arrives October 14 through <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>, an 11-song set schooled in classic Americana and led by the new single &quot;Lone Ranger.&quot; You can hear the track at Bandcamp or see it performed in a new video on YouTube. A press release further reveals that the song has deep roots in the artist&#39;s catalogue, with Riolino recalling that it was the first she ever performed for friends as a fledgling musician. It appears here, refocused, nearly ten years later.</p><p>Riolino recorded with a full band in August 2020 at Aaron Goldstein&#39;s now-defunct Baldwin Street Sound studio, with the producer adding his signature pedal steel to the instrumental mix. The album features nearly the full modern Outfit lineup in their usual roles, augmented by bassist Ryan Gavel (<a href="https://youngguv.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Young Guv</a>), keyboardist Thomas Hammerton (<a href="https://nathanlawr.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nathan Lawr</a>), percussionist Jason Bhattachary (<a href="http://www.danedmondsmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dan Edmonds</a>), and Anthony Ronaldi on baritone sax. JR commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Recording live made for some long days, but it was a lot of fun and I had the benefit of working with some really talented people,&quot; Riolino says. &quot;It helped create this feeling of glimpsing a moment in time. It&#39;s like therapy: I could just let out this period of life and then move forward.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_Qqnefjglg" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=perestroika><span class=artist-title><a href="https://perestroika-mtl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Perestroika</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Distraction&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/hUEvjEt3Scs" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://perestroika-mtl.bandcamp.com/album/monolith" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Last week at <a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/77669/videos-montreals-perestroika-throw-a-dark-new-wave-dance-party-with-distraction" class="" target=_blank>Punknews</a>, I premiered the new video from Montreal&#39;s sinister <a href="https://perestroika-mtl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Perestroika</a>, sharing an extended mix of the single &quot;Distraction&quot; from the trio&#39;s recent record <em>Monolith</em>. That album, produced by <a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a>&#39;s Jonah Falco, first surfaced online late last year, with a CD version newly available through the Polish label <a href="https://www.batcaveproductions.pl" class="" target=_blank>Bat Cave</a>. The band&#39;s dark new wave attack gives a contemporary synthpunk spin on a range of goth and post-punk influences, worshipping at the altar of Kino, Roxy Music, Killing Joke, Sisters of Mercy, Musta Paraati, and Giorgio Moroder.</p><p>The glitch-heavy video for &quot;Distraction&quot; came together in November of last year under the direction of <a href="https://priorsmtl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>PRIORS</a>&#39; Alan Hildebrandt (through <a href="https://www.studiodelscorpio.com/" class="" target=_blank>Studio Del Scorpio</a>). Founding member Shravan Deolalikar revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The music video is a commentary on the constant bombardment of the media of specific fear-mongering geopolitical events to keep us continually distracted from the most immediate problems in our lives. Further adding to the desensitization, stress, and absurdity of modern society...&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Perestroika emerged in 2017 as the home-recording project of Shravan Deolalikar, US ex-pat and a former bassist for bands like Richmond, VA&#39;s Lost Tribe. After experimenting solo with the 80s-rooted sounds of post-punk, new wave, and synthpop, the act grew to include guitarist Gustavo Rodriguez (<a href="https://malokio.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Malokio</a>) and vocalist Taylor Hoodlum Stevenson (The Omegas, <a href="https://mickeydagger.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mickey Dagger</a>, <a href="https://youngblades.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Young Blades</a>).</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hUEvjEt3Scs" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=adam_mowery_the_worry_warts><span class=artist-title><a href="https://itsadammowery.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Adam Mowery &amp; The Worry Warts</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Oldies 93&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Listen at <a href="https://youtu.be/zHXcNzmMV1I" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="http://papalvisit.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Papal Visit</a> frontman <a href="https://itsadammowery.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Adam Mowery</a> has a new single out titled &quot;Oldies 93,&quot; a lo-fi garage tribute to the early format of Saint John radio station CFBC (it swapped to modern country in 2013).

The maturing jangle-pop act&#39;s readying the new record for an August 12 release through <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a>, showing off a sleeker, synth-peppered version of their sound resulting from sessions with producer Dan Boeckner (Operators, Wolf Parade). The accompanying video, directed by the Morgan Waters (of the ex-Weaves hyperpop act <a href="https://pinkblob.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pink Blob</a>), features cameos from the above-mentioned Jonah Falco, TSN personality Jay Onrait, and comedians Tom Henry and Rodrigo Fernandez-Stoll (the latter&#39;s first of two appearances in this week&#39;s newsletter, oddly enough).</p><p>Singer/guitarist Jeremy Gaudet commented on the sound&#39;s prominent synths and the imagery present in the video:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;People are always trying to sign into my email. What do they think they&#39;re gonna find? The public appetite for dirty laundry is wild. Having moved the world online has not helped. Boeckner had the idea to use the Moog sound for the hook, which was originally on guitar, and that sound brings the song into a sort of new-wave territory that was fun and different for us. We kept referencing the vibe of Michael Mann movies when recording the album, and then Morgan (director Morgan Waters) heard this and came up with the idea of making the video look like the movie Heat. We also were wearing these hockey masks filming all day next to a busy road getting a lot of car honks and didn&#39;t realize until much later that we filmed on an actual Friday the 13th.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new record, the band&#39;s third, follows 2021&#39;s <em>Cooler Returns</em>. Kiwi Jr. features vocalist/guitarist Jeremy Gaudet, guitarist Brian Murphy, bassist Mike Walker, and drummer Brohan Moore.

The quartet issued the four-song <em>Love Business</em> EP earlier this month, a riffy set you can pick up at Bandcamp. In a press release, the group shared a desire to reconnect with songwriting that&#39;s perhaps a little more immediate than their other outlets:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;...The <em>Love Business</em> EP is the result of me (Max) wanting to write catchy and fun music with friends without overthinking anything, It was an opportunity for me to experiment more with pop oriented melodies and hooks while writing most often from other perspectives than my own. It was also another chance for me to experiment with different recording techniques and tones.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Seed Toss features Max Lajoie (<a href="https://spitehousemtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Spite House</a>, <a href="https://deeperwell.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Deeper Well</a>), Donavan Robert (<a href="https://argumentmtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Argument</a>), Marco (<a href="https://privatehellmtl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Private Hell</a>), and John Donnelly (<a href="https://thefakefriends.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Fake Friends</a>, <a href="http://mundysbay.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mundy&#39;s Bay</a>).</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1400342623/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://seedtossmtl.bandcamp.com/album/love-business">Love Business by Seed Toss</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=dead_soft><span class=artist-title><a href="http://dead-soft.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dead Soft</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Glimpse&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://deadsoft.bandcamp.com/track/glimpse" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>On a similar sonic wavelength, the grungy BC power-pop act <a href="http://dead-soft.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dead Soft</a> kicked off the summer with another digital single, this one titled &quot;Glimpse.&quot; It follows January&#39;s &quot;Brain&#39;s Fried,&quot; and if I had to guess, is another in their string of homespun tunes recorded in the group&#39;s shed on Gabriola Island.

In a press release, he comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;My new single, &#39;Sugar Boy,&#39; is inspired by a Hollywood-esque new romance that ends in heartbreak. This song pays homage to the classic romantic-style pop song. The &#39;hero&#39; at the centre of this track experiences misleading, unrequited love, a topic that is likely familiar to most. I enjoyed juxtaposing sad lyrical content with the upbeat and energetic melody of the song.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track arrived alongside a rather adorable video from director Garett McKelvie and is slated for inclusion on an upcoming self-titled LP from <a href="https://psychicreadingsrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Psychic Readings Records</a>. Trout recorded with Brett Humber at Kingsville, Ontario&#39;s Sound Foundry Studios. His band features guitarist James Brown, bassist Colin Wysman, and drummer Joshua Cassidy. Jeremy Coulter added the track&#39;s piano and organ parts at Swamp Songs in Lucan, Ontario with engineer Matt Westlake.</p><p>Roye Trout&#39;s eminently likable split with Jesse Fellows arrived this past April with the misleadingly aggressive title of <em>Our Hell</em>.

I came across Joe Bressler&#39;s work and loved it and he lived in New York so we decided to collaborate. We loosely discussed locations, but without knowing, he ended up choosing some places that had great personal sentimental significance to me. I love how the video ends with this beautiful ballerina finally out free and dancing&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Parks&#39; long-awaited new album, issued in May through <a href="https://fuzzclub.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fuzz Club</a> and <a href="https://www.handdrawndracula.com" class="" target=_blank>Hand Drawn Dracula</a>, followed up on her 2013 full-length <em>Blood Hot</em>.

When a moment&#39;s hesitation can send one spiralling, when the smallest task can stand in the way, when you find it in a place you least expect it, like a souvenir stuffed deep in your drawer, you can let it wash over you or try your best to will it away. Souvenir is about finding your footing, even when the ground beneath you can only crumble.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new record lands on August 5 through <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a> in Canada and <a href="http://www.fatwreck.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fat Wreck Chords</a> elsewhere.

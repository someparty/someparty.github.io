For bands following up releases from 2017, which at any other time would be an utterly unnoteworthy span between records, this is an odd moment indeed. We may wistfully look to the winter of 2019 as our last moment of naive innocence, but 2017 feels downright unfathomable. It&#39;s an entirely different universe, and our prior notions of &quot;recent memory&quot; just don&#39;t apply anymore. So while <a href="https://needlesxpins.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Needles//Pins</a>&#39; <em>Good Night Tomorrow</em> may, objectively, only be a few years in the past, its 2021 successor lands like a goddamn life preserver.</p><p>&quot;A Rather Strained Apologetic&quot; shouldn&#39;t feel this vital. The Vancouver group&#39;s performing a well-worn style of anthemic, midtempo punk rock that would have fit well with the No Idea roster of the early 2000s. The song&#39;s wrapped in that agreeable stripe of gruff emo that even those of us who bristle at the genre readily admit a soft spot for (Jawbreaker, Hot Water Music, Small Brown Bike, and the like). I hate to perpetuate the Orgcore label, lest I own up to my role in perpetuating it, but the denizens of Punknews in its heyday would be all over this. Familiar feels different, though, in the uncertain apex of this pandemic. &quot;Apologetic&quot; sounds like the before times - like shouting along with a massive chorus - one clearly assembled as a shameless crowd-pleaser - fists in the air in a decidedly unhygienic bar. I&#39;d be critical of the whole affair if I wasn&#39;t so desperate for it.</p><p>The track&#39;s one of 10 slated for the band&#39;s self-titled effort, due May 28 through Portland&#39;s venerable <a href="https://dirtcultrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dirt Cult Records</a>. It&#39;s the group&#39;s fourth proper full-length, following up on the above-mentioned <em>Good Night Tomorrow</em> and a 2018 split with the English punk group <a href="https://epicproblem2.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Epic Problem</a>.</p><p>I can&#39;t wait to hear more. They should market this thing as a therapeutic.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3492988386/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=1742145262/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://dirtcultrecords.bandcamp.com/album/needles-pins">Needles//Pins by Needles//Pins</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=intersystems><span class=artist-title><a href="https://intersystems.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Intersystems</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Revelation of the Birds&quot; / &quot;Sonny Abilene II&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://intersystems.bandcamp.com/album/4" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Yet, just as I opine about the metaphysical gulf between 2017 and today, here&#39;s a gap that&#39;s magnitudes larger...</p><p>Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://intersystems.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Intersystems</a>, a psychedelic multimedia collective formed back in 1967, unexpectedly returns this April with a new record. <em>Intersystems #IV</em> arrives April 30 as a 6 track LP, with an additional three songs (the <em>Unfinished World</em> EP) included on the CD and digital editions. The set, arriving via <a href="http://www.waveshapermedia.com/" class="" target=_blank>Waveshaper Media</a>, marks the group&#39;s first full platter of new material since 1968.</p><p>Intersystems came together in the late 60s, initially comprised of architect Dik Zander, light sculptor Michael Hayden, poet Blake Parker, and the classically trained musician John Mills-Cockell (who later went on to form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(band)" class="" target=_blank>Syrinx</a>). The band&#39;s pioneering era, which found them on the vanguard of electronic music, is celebrated in the press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Where more conventional purveyors of psychedelia seemed content to use fuzztone guitar and orientalist tropes to approximate altered states, Intersystems built psychedelic experiences of their own from the ground up that embraced all the euphoric wonder and terror. The sonic aspect alone offered a singularly unsettling vision. They initially wrangled homespun gadgetry, feverishly spliced-together tapes, and mutant beat poetry, but soon became among the very first to deploy a Moog Synthesizer. Their custom modular rig — purchased by Mills-Cockell directly from Robert Moog&#39;s Trumansburg Headquarters — was the first of its kind in Canada.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Intersystems&#39; new work arrives nearly fifty years after <em>Free Psychedelic Poster Inside</em>, the final record of their original run. Michael Hayden and John Mills-Cockell convened at Hamilton&#39;s storied Grant Avenue Studio to record in 2015, but had to make a few bold choices given the absence of their original lineup. The release elaborates:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The resultant music remains remarkably congruent with the project&#39;s original impulse, yet irrefutably of the present moment. Taking cues from its stark, aforementioned predecessor, a modular Moog synthesizer system is the primary instrument, but here the sonorities that Mills-Cockell conjures are dynamic and diverse, blending barbed wire bass-lines, Subotnickesque chirps, gestural plumes of colour, percussive fligree and more. The 2007 death of poet/lyricist/ vocalist Blake Parker also drastically impacts Intersystems sound, especially since the alternative the group devised is so audacious. Parker&#39;s words are rendered electronically and the computer-synthesized voices alternate between an eerily life-like delivery and slurred cybernetic faltering, bringing a glossy dystopian veneer to the group&#39;s anxious surrealism.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can experience two idiosyncratic new songs streaming at Bandcamp now: &quot;Revelation of the Birds&quot; and &quot;Sonny Abilene II.&quot;</p><p>The new material arrives in the wake of 2015&#39;s reissue of Intersystems&#39; full discography on the Italian archival label Alga Marghen (and the subsequent revival of the Syrinx discography in the years since).</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3242173503/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://intersystems.bandcamp.com/album/4">#4 by Intersystems</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=n0v3l><span class=artist-title><a href="https://n0v3l.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>N0V3L</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Group Disease&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://n0v3l.bandcamp.com/track/group-disease" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>BC post-punk unit <a href="https://n0v3l.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>N0V3L</a> returns this spring with their debut full-length. <em>Non-Fiction</em> is slated for a May 28 release from Calgary&#39;s <a href="http://www.flemisheye.com/" class="" target=_blank>Flemish Eye</a> and the UK-based Tin Angel imprint <a href="https://twitter.com/meatmachinerecs" class="" target=_blank>Meat Machine Records</a>. You can preview the sombre new wave vibes of &quot;Group Disease,&quot; the record&#39;s first single, at Bandcamp now.</p><p>The high-concept album&#39;s described in a press release as a &quot;treatise on modern existence and the perverse parameters within which it&#39;s experienced.&quot; It elaborates:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#39;s a collection of agile, carefully-constructed post-punk, new wave, funk, and garage rock that&#39;s been zapped and warped by an opioid overdose crisis, mental illness, populism, and the merciless onward march of time. Intimate sadnesses and structural violences are blurred to the jagged quirk of sharp guitars, commanding bass, acrid saxophone, and mournful keys, all propelled ever forward by nimble drumming. It&#39;s dark and occasionally danceable, a macabre late-capitalist disco under a pall of confusion.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band crafted the 11-song set between 2017 and 2020, recording to an 8-track Tascam-388 with Bryce Cloghesy (Military Genius, <a href="https://crackcloud.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Crack Cloud</a>) producing and mixing. The press release sorrowfully notes that the rental home where these songs came together no longer exists, the property since digested by Vancouver&#39;s insatiable housing market. The collectively-minded five-piece, fronted by vocalist Jon Varley, has since scattered across the province and left without a shared headquarters.</p><p>The new record follows the band&#39;s debut 2019 EP <em>NOVEL</em> and a 2020 split release with the Australian dub/krautrock hybrid <a href="https://exek.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Exek</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3390072848/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=2986467353/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://n0v3l.bandcamp.com/album/non-fiction">NON-FICTION by N0V3L</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=jyraph><span class=artist-title><a href="https://jyraph.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jyraph</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;30th Century Man&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://jyraph.bandcamp.com/track/30th-century-man" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>The enigmatic Montreal songwriting project <a href="https://jyraph.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jyraph</a> has a new cover online, tackling Scott Walker&#39;s 1969 classic &quot;30th Century Man.&quot; Jyraph&#39;s version takes on the irresistible quality of a campfire sing-along, a notion aided by the loose and playful backing vocals. The post-punk artist commented on the track in an update to Facebook:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Music is a tough thing sometimes, so sometimes I like to record a cover of a song I like as quickly as possible. Preferably recorded and mixed within an hour. Do everything as quickly as possible and not think about it. Then subject other people to it. Play it cool, and saran wrap all you can.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The cover follows last fall&#39;s single &quot;La Brume&quot; and lands a year out from the expansive &quot;Jaibo (a crab&#39;s tail)&quot; (with an isolation-era dump of archival material arriving in between the two). Jyraph&#39;s the solo project of Pablo Garcia-Rejon Gaubeca of Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://palmetto.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Palmetto</a>. Under this name, he last released the full-length <em>El Fuego</em> in 2018.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=725672834/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://jyraph.bandcamp.com/track/30th-century-man">30th Century Man by Jyraph</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=joncro><span class=artist-title><a href="https://joncro.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>JONCRO</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Sakura&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://joncro.bandcamp.com/track/sakura-2" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Mississauga trio <a href="https://joncro.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>JONCRO</a> has another preview of their forthcoming <em>Richmond Station</em> online, sharing the alternately grungy and forlorn &quot;Sakura.&quot; It&#39;s a buzzsaw stomp that surfaces as a wistful love song in the chorus. Like last week&#39;s &quot;Passa Passa&quot; the track goes for a bit of a walk once the vocals wrap, content to let the band hang around and jam instrumentally, with no particular rush to the finish line. JONCRO performs this trick incredibly well, without it ever feeling like an indulgence.</p><p>The band commented on the song in an Instagram post:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It is a tragic love song about dealing with the emotions that come from the end of a relationship and the nostalgic pain that comes with remembering the good times you had with someone and the love you once shared with them that is now gone from your life. Love, whether platonic or romantic, is one of the most important emotions humans can feel and the loss of it can be truly devastating. thematically it is framed against the backdrop of cherry blossoms falling at twilight.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>JONCRO features Daniel G. Wilson on guitar and vocals, drummer Matthew Mikuljan, and bassist Kieran Christie. Wilson recorded the song at the band&#39;s home studio, The Lions Den, with Austin Nops of <a href="https://store.theeffens.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Effens</a> mixing and mastering at Lootbag Studios.</p><p>The group last released the live <em>Lions Den Session</em> set in December of 2020, having issued <em>The Joncro Mountains</em> EP just a few months prior. The <em>Richmond Station</em> LP is due later this year.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3881635467/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://joncro.bandcamp.com/track/sakura-2">Sakura by JONCRO</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=beams><span class=artist-title><a href="https://beamsbeams.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Beams</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Ego Death</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Livestream Friday, March 26 at 8:00 EST at <a href="https://beamsbeams.bandcamp.com/merch/ego-death-a-concert-film" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto&#39;s psych-flavoured folk-rock group <a href="https://beamsbeams.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Beams</a> have a new 10-song full-length due this week, and they&#39;re launching it with a filmographic love letter to the beleaguered physical performance spaces of their hometown.</p><p>The group will stream <em>Ego Death</em>, a ticketed full-length concert film, on the album&#39;s release day (this Friday, March 26).

The Calgarian artist commented on the piece:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I started by re-filming some old footage of my fam in places like Banff and Sylvan Lake. I combined that with photos of anything circular in my studio. After that, I started to panic, and sat down and drew whatever came to my burned out mind hole overtop of those backgrounds. A lot of fruit. A lot of Lamborghini Countach. I have a button on my computer that morphs the drawings together. It&#39;s very satisfying and trippy. Go out into nature instead of watching the video.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The beloved surrealist songwriter launched <em>Gardener</em> last week on <a href="http://www.flemisheye.com/" class="" target=_blank>Flemish Eye</a> in Canada and <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a> elsewhere.

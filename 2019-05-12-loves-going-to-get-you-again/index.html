Titled <em>City Sex Vol. 2</em>, the LP is due on June 14. It was tracked at Arner&#39;s Tonehenge studio.</p><p>In a <a href="https://exclaim.ca/music/article/vancouvers_mr_merlot_unveils_city_sex_volume_2_lp_premieres_loves_going_to_get_you_again" class="" target=_blank>statement</a>, Ondzik commented on the six-song record, which follows up on 2017&#39;s <em>Vol. 1</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;City Sex is a term I came up with to describe the sexuality of the city dweller, which tends to be more progressive than the rural and often has less barriers. Sadly, men are still afraid of love because it demands they show weakness, vulnerability, and tenderness, all things they&#39;re terrified of. Women are afraid of love because men can kill them, refuse to reveal their compassion, or deal with their ego. Love is treated like a transaction, and with that, it loses its real power to change and influence.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>With the announcement came the new track &quot;Love&#39;s Going to Get You Again.&quot; It features guest solos by both Lougheed and Bragg. In a further comment Ondzik addressed the song&#39;s apparent Joy Division callback head-on:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Love&#39;s Going to Get You Again&#39; is sort of a response to &#39;Love Will Tear Us Apart.&#39; Love is more powerful than we give it credit for and its important to remember that if you close your heart off, you&#39;ll never be nourished nor will love find you as the song goes. Love is a risk that only rewards bravery and stupidity, it doesn&#39;t wait, it demands you risk yourself in order to fully experience its pleasures and joys. I don&#39;t believe it tears you apart, pain is a necessary component of love and loving and provides the difference that ultimately defines the goodness of love. I wrote this song specifically for those who maybe need a reminder. Maybe it&#39;ll take your whole life to find what you are looking for in someone, maybe it happened yesterday, but it will find you if you are searching. Maybe that&#39;s too cosmic for most people but I feel like you have to suspend your disbelief and power through your doubts in order to reach a greater truth.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3503021374/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1961596005/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://mrmerlot.bandcamp.com/album/city-sex-vol-2">City Sex Vol. 2 by Mr Merlot</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://mrmerlot.bandcamp.com/track/loves-going-to-get-you-again" class="black no-underline fw4 db tc f6 nt3 mb4" target=_blank>Listen: Mr. Merlot - &quot;Love&#39;s Going to Get You Again&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p><a href="http://www.petraglynt.zone/" class="" target=_blank>Petra Glynt</a> has a new video online for the track &quot;New Growth,&quot; one of the highlights the art-punk/electropop artist&#39;s LP. The Montreal-based musician spoke to Exclaim about how she found inspiration for the song through the #MeToo movement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;While there is still no real protocol for how to address instances of sexual harassment and assault, there is so much victory in how fellow non-men strengthened their support systems as a result of #metoo. It&#39;s monumental. I was able to take a closer look at my past experiences with men and identify how many had been unacceptable; starting with my first kiss, right up until very recently in my life... Awakening to that knowledge really moved something inside of me. It made me sick to my stomach, but it also made me feel alive and ready to dismantle the patriarchy.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The Paz Ramirez-directed video reinterprets a scene from David Lynch&#39;s 1990 film <em>Wild at Heart</em> with that sentiment brought to the fore.

On the day the record dropped they shared a new video for the track &quot;Boujee Natives.&quot; The band had this to say about the song in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;When you think of boujee, you think of an elite class of people with an appetite for luxury and high-end materials. When we say &#39;Boujee Natives&#39; we are letting you know our wealth lies in our culture, traditions, and everything Mother Earth provides for us. Boujee Natives stems from our belief that everyone is an artist in one way shape or form and that we were all created to create but it&#39;s up to us as individuals to find out what that is for ourselves. We wanted to showcase all the badass First Nations artists that have welcomed us into their worlds as we were coming into ourselves and developing our artistry into what it is today.

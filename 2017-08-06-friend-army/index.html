The first single from the new record is titled &quot;Friend Army&quot; and finds the group in full rock&#39;n&#39;roll mode backing some of Kom&#39;s signature wordplay.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wTu5HXq4D-Q?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><em>Revival Beach</em> was recorded and mixed by Al Harle at <a href="http://www.bigjellystudios.com/" class="" target=_blank>Big Jelly Studios</a> in Ramsgate, UK this past June.

The seven song set was produced, mixed, and engineered by Ian Romano (of the aforementioned Attack In Black), who also drums on the recordings. Ross Miller of Single Mothers and the Dirty Nil plays bass and additional guitar on the songs. Given how much Thomson draws on anxiety and sarcasm on Single Mothers records, it&#39;s nice to hear his approach when the stylistic confines of punk rock are lifted a little.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=761993831/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://drewthomson.bandcamp.com/album/the-drew-thomson-foundation-vol-1-huh-its-generally-pretty-empty-in-here">The Drew Thomson Foundation Vol 1: Huh, it's generally pretty empty in here by The Drew Thomson Foundation</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p>Ottawa pop-punk group <a href="http://www.theriptides.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Riptides</a> are gearing up for a September 12th release of their new 18 song full-length <em>Canadian Graffiti</em>.

The Windsor-via-Sackville rock band seems to be doing just about everything right in the lead up to <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> this fall. Everything the group&#39;s released so far has been enormously fun and the new single &quot;Play The Field&quot; continues that trend. The song&#39;s featured in a new music video directed by Lesley Marshall and filmed at the University of Windsor. Josée Caron described the new track:</p><blockquote><p>This song is based on a true story of when I was in grade eight. My friends were really good at sports but I definitely was not; I was eager to belong. I gathered all my courage and tried out for my school basketball team. Somehow I made it past tryouts and onto the single ‘A’ team. I was so happy to just be on a team, it didn’t matter that I would only score one basket all season, or that I would score on my own team.</p><p>Lucy (Niles) and I try to channel that blissful state in this song, which could be described as an effort to reclaim some of our dignity by surrendering to our true talents. It’s about admiring, romanticizing, and desiring the dignified excellence that seems to come along with being good at sports, knowing it’s something you will never truly experience but not really minding because you’re stoked that you get to hang out with your crush at practice.</p></blockquote><p>Caron and Niles provided some further background on their writing process in an interview at <a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1954647/band-to-watch-partner/franchises/interview/" class="" target=_blank>Stereogum</a>.

The festival, now in its 15th year, will take place in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec from August 31st through September 3rd. The 70 acts performing in this small mining town represent a pretty huge variety of genres, everything from folk to hip hop to metal and electronic music at equal measure in both French and English. I&#39;ll highlight a few of the Canadian acts performing each week this month.</p><p>Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://duchesssays.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Duchess Says</a> are FME veterans, having played the event on at least three prior occasions. Founded in 2003, the four-piece plays what I&#39;ve seen kicked around as kraut-punk, synth-punk, or moog-rock. Any and all of those labels could be attached to the band&#39;s sprawling third full-length, <em>Sciences Nouvelles</em>, which was released in late 2016 on <a href="https://www.slovenly.com/" class="" target=_blank>Slovenly</a> and <a href="https://www.bonsound.com" class="" target=_blank>Bonsound</a>. At this year&#39;s festival, Duchess Says cap off the opening night with a show at the Petit Théâtre du Vieux Noranda featuring Parisian dance-punk act Slosh and Montreal prog quintet Atsuko Chiba also on the bill.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZjvnmiqmXQY?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p>Also hailing from Montreal, <a href="https://chocolatmtl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chocolat</a> is currently supporting their third full-length, <em>Rencontrer Looloo</em>.

Musically Chocolat shift often from charging hard rock to danceable grooves, taking as many genre twists over the course of the record as their trippy lyrical concept allows.

It&#39;s a 5-track set — an EP&#39;s worth of new music pressed as a 12&quot; LP (classify that as you will). The group shared the news alongside a video for the new single &quot;Freeloader Feast.&quot; From the press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Deliluh&#39;s live propensity to ignore the traditional circuit of bars and clubs in favour of unconventional venues has built a reputation at home, and one they intend to maintain. Foregoing the clean polish of professional studios for living spaces of contextual importance, Deliluh&#39;s dedication to thoughtful writing and analog documentation has been a constant process that&#39;s kept loyal fans highly anticipating their culminate fruit.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Putting aside the phrase &quot;culminate fruit,&quot; which should never be uttered again, that statement lines up well with my understanding of Deliluh as a <em>band&#39;s band</em>. As a group, they make relatively little self-promotional noise, but regardless their name&#39;s in constant circulation. Their biggest proponents seem to be the members of other bands, with the very-online members of Toronto&#39;s amorphous garage-rock scene leading the charge.</p><p>&quot;Freeloader Feast&quot; is one result from a year of sessions recorded at Toronto veterans&#39; hall The Owls Club. It finds the band tightly wound. Here they&#39;re decidedly more acerbic than where we left them on their oft slow-burning 2017 LP <em>Day Catcher</em>. There&#39;s a sense of unravelling here, sold as Kyle Knapp&#39;s deadpan spoken lyrics become increasingly frantic and unbalanced. With shades of The Fall and early Wire, it sets the band apace with Minneapolis&#39; celebrated Uranium Club in the current strata of weirdo post-punk.</p><p>Johnny de Courcy shot the video for &quot;Feast&quot; on 16mm film. It finds friends and neighbours of the band sitting in conversation, discussing their daily lives. The group distressed the negatives through various means (boiling, burning, bleaching, etc) to create a skewed visual effect that fits the mood of the song wonderfully. Maria Todorov-Topouzov edited the clip.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nsd1wFeFVqs" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Nsd1wFeFVqs" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Deliluh - &quot;Freeloader Feast&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto&#39;s neo-proto-punk group <a href="https://protruders.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Protruders</a> also recently announced a new full-length, their first vinyl LP after a string of self-released cassettes. The set, titled <em>Poison Future</em>, is due April 20 from Virginia&#39;s <a href="https://feelitrecords.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Feel It Records</a>. Eddie Flowers of Vulcher Magazine and The Gizmos wrote the press release, commenting (in part):</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The sound is a bit clearer and maybe a little beefier — some of the noise gives way to a more relaxed and expansive approach. The psych quotient is higher. But the heart of the band is still beating for the sort of raw open-minded non-generic punk that once came from the likes of Rocket From The Tombs, Swell Maps, Dead Moon, Dancing Cigarettes, etc.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Protruders recorded with Peter Greenwood at The Bottle Garden in Montréal last year. Daniel Husayn mastered the new set at the North London Bomb Factory. You can stream &quot;Hydrophytol,&quot; a track that charges along atop some wildly unhinged sax noise, over at Bandcamp.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1061390339/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://feelitrecords.bandcamp.com/album/poison-future">Poison Future by Protruders</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://feelitrecords.bandcamp.com/album/poison-future" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Protruders - &quot;Hydrophytol&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Experimental Montreal rock outfit <a href="https://atsukochiba.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Atsuko Chiba</a> have a new record on the way for April. <em>Trace</em> will arrive on the 12th from <a href="https://www.mothland.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mothland</a>. The 8-song set closes with the song &quot;New Folds,&quot; an 8-minute prog/psych epic that the group&#39;s showcasing with a new 360 degree YouTube video from director Anthony Sifoni. The five-piece tracked the new record with Matthew Cerantola. Chris Common provided the master. Vivianne Roy (of <a href="http://www.laurasauvage.com/" class="" target=_blank>Laura Sauvage</a>) appears on several tracks as a backing vocalist as well.</p><p><em>Trace</em> follows a pair of EPs the band released in 2016 (<em>Figure and Ground</em> and <em>The Memory Empire</em>), and will be their second LP following 2013&#39;s <em>Jinn</em>. Atsuko Chiba features Karim Lakhdar (guitar/vocals/synths), Eric Schafhauser (guitar/synths), Kevin McDonald (guitar/synths), David Palumbo (bass/vocals), and Anthony Piazza (drums).

The group, notable as <a href="http://joelplaskett.com/" class="" target=_blank>Joel Plaskett</a>&#39;s main gig before his solo career exploded, is celebrating the 20th anniversary of their final album, the <a href="http://www.sonicunyon.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sonic Unyon</a>-released <em>Clayton Park</em>. The 1999-era record will arrive on vinyl for the first time to coincide with <a href="http://recordstoredaycanada.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Record Store Day</a> on April 13, and the group will support it with a handful of shows later this year.</p><p>The limited-time reunion will feature original members Joel Plaskett, Rob Benvie, Ian McGettigan, and Cliff Gibb performing fall gigs in Moncton, Halifax, Ottawa, London, and Toronto. After their big announcement (made on the March 24 edition of <a href="http://strombo.com/radio/" class="" target=_blank>The Strombo Show</a>), Plaskett put out a statement which read (in part):</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I’m very much looking forward to playing a handful of shows with the guys again... <em>Clayton Park</em> was a special record for us, marking the end of the ‘90s and our time as band. It’s tempting to say I can’t believe it’s been 20 years but, frankly, I can believe it. We’ve all been busy with other endeavors and our families so finding the window to do this was a little challenging. It will be fun to fire up the motor again, both to celebrate the music and to spend time together as friends as we clocked a lot of kilometres together in the 1990s. It’s also great to finally have the record on vinyl, as Ian’s artwork looks stellar in a larger format. The Hermit rides again (at least from Halifax to Toronto)!”</p></blockquote><p>If you want to dig further into the story behind of this record, Vice published a pretty comprehensive <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/d3mbqv/an-oral-history-of-thrush-hermits-clayton-park" class="" target=_blank>oral history</a> last week with in-depth commentary from everyone involved.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M6vBx9pkZnY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/M6vBx9pkZnY" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Thrush Hermit - <em>Clayton Park</em> @ YouTube</a></p><p>Ottawa&#39;s usually-denim-clad party punks <a href="https://newswears.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>New Swears</a> are up to something. The group released a music video for a new song titled &quot;Angel&quot; last week, a clip that lands the normally shambolic group somewhere on the pop spectrum between cheesy 80s new wave and a plastic 90s boy band. Is this new direction all an elaborately produced joke? Are they mocking the second-act synthpop reinvention that afflicts so many of today&#39;s ex-punks? Are they charging headfirst into teen shmaltz to unlock some of that major label cash? Nobody&#39;s talking.</p><p>The comments left under the &quot;Angel&quot; YouTube video are wonderful though. My favourite is the person asking &quot;Is it bad if I like this?&quot;</p><p>New Swears&#39; last full-length was 2017&#39;s <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone</a>-released <em>and the Magic of Horses</em>.

Musically, it&#39;s everywhere we&#39;ve been and everywhere we&#39;re going. We tried to re-imagine and re-contextualize the tools we are comfortable using to make something new. The lyrics try to evoke a number of things within each line - mental exhaustion, content fatigue, tours of duty and alienation - and the images in the video reflect these overlapping concepts. The song lands somewhere between Unwound&#39;s New Plastic Ideas and Check Your Head by the Beastie Boys. Or something. I don&#39;t know. You tell me.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Arc Light&quot; arrived alongside a Rachelle Walker-directed video, which you can find below.</p><p><em>Age Hasn&#39;t Spoiled You</em> will be Greys&#39; third full length, following 2016&#39;s <em>Outer Heaven</em> and it&#39;s companion piece <em>Warm Shadow</em>. The new record also arrives in the wake of recent solo recordings from Jiwani (<a href="https://goldendrag.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Golden Drag</a>&#39;s <em>Pink Sky</em>) and <a href="https://crgillespie.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>C.R. Gillespie</a>&#39;s (<em>Séance Works</em>).

We bought ear plugs and I should have used them.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The original version of &quot;Innocence&quot; appears on Chastity&#39;s striking 2018 debut <em>Death Lust</em>, released last July on <a href="http://www.capturedtracks.com/" class="" target=_blank>Captured Tracks</a> and <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain Records</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2vX1mtJmFQ" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/a2vX1mtJmFQ" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Chastity - &quot;Innocence&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Windsor slacker rock act <a href="https://www.partnerband.com" class="" target=_blank>Partner</a> continues to share music from their fast-approaching new EP <em>Saturday the 14th</em>. The latest is &quot;Angels Wings,&quot; a lush ballad the band presented in both English and French. Josée Caron and Lucy Nile had this to say in the premiere at <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/03/exclusive-hear-partners-transcendent-new-song-ange.html" class="" target=_blank>Paste</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Angel’s Wings&#39; is a song based on a poem by Cedric Sims. It is a collaboration in the style of Elton John and Bernie Taupin. It was also inspired by the grand themes and powerful performances found in Céline Dion songs, so we made a French version too. This song is about going down to &#39;hell&#39; to face your greatest fears. The song explores how, by having the courage to face your fears head on, you find you possess a strength you never knew. In order to craft this song, we had to face our greatest fears as artists. So form imitates content. Facing our fears is never easy, but there is life on the other side of fear. It’s so important to remind ourselves of this. We hope our listeners can be reminded of this fundamental truth and enjoy the ride!&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Saturday the 14th</em> arrives on April 5 from <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You’ve Changed</a> and <a href="http://www.fatherdaughterrecords.com" class="" target=_blank>Father/Daughter Records</a>. It&#39;ll arrive as both a four-song 45 RPM 12&quot; LP and a five-song CD (with the French version of this new track exclusive to the CD). The set, which follows 2017&#39;s <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>, was mixed by Chris Shaw (Weezer, Sloan, Ted Leo) and mastered by João Carvalho (Alexisonfire, Silverstein).</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QTLVZ00KSJk" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/QTLVZ00KSJk" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Partner - &quot;Angel&#39;s Wings&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enRaT3VAn80" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/enRaT3VAn80" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Partner - &quot;Les ailes d&#39;un ange&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p><a href="http://www.odonisodonis.com/" class="" target=_blank>Odonis Odonis</a>&#39; shared another preview from their new EP <em>Reaction</em> last week. &quot;Insect&quot; is an intense track that surfaced as part of the Toronto industrial act&#39;s live set over the past year.

The <a href="https://www.folkontherocks.com/" class="" target=_blank>Folk On The Rocks</a> festival in Yellowknife runs from July 12 to 14, with appearances scheduled from Lido Pimienta, Snotty Nose Rez Kids, Nap Eyes, and Wintersleep among others. <a href="https://riverandsky.ca/" class="" target=_blank>River and Sky</a> takes place on the banks of the Sturgeon River between Sudbury and North Bay from July 18 to 21. That event has Fucked Up, U.S. Girls, Orville Peck, Yamantaka // Sonic Titan, Tommy and the Commies, Pottery, Hollerado, and Fast Romantics among the confirmed. The <a href="https://riverfestelora.com/" class="" target=_blank>Elora Riverfest</a> in Elora, Ontario goes down from August 16 to 18, with City and Colour, A Tribe Called Red, the Joel Plaskett Emergency, Hubert Lenior, Pkew Pkew Pkew, Bonjay, Jessie Reyez, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones (!?) and many others signed up. On a smaller scale the third round of bands for Ottawa&#39;s June 6 punk, metal, and hardcore event <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sotofestottawa" class="" target=_blank>Sitting On The Outside</a> includes PRIORS, Piper Maru, Deathsticks, Grave Infestation, and Spacers.</p><p>That&#39;s just scratching the surface, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing a few, but my award for <em>coolest</em> festival promo goes out to Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://www.distorsionpsychfest.com/" class="" target=_blank>Distortion Psych Fest</a>. That event runs from May 8 to 10 and features the likes of Atsuko Chiba, ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead, Bleu Nuit, Les Breastfeeders, CRABE, Lemongrab, Petra Glynt, Suuns, WHOOP-Szo, and more. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s a nice lineup, but what makes it truly great is this wild trailer that frames the whole shindig as an 80s video game.

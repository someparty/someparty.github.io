Welcome to <a href="https://pneumatictube.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pneumatic Tube</a> and their six-song, sub-nine-minute EP of weirdo scuzz punk. I&#39;ve always been fascinated how albums, and even entire bands, sometimes emerge from the ether unexpectedly so I reached out to Burger for some details. The new project emerged from the root cause of all good punk music: boredom.</p><blockquote><p>Honestly, man, Dave and I got together one night because we were bored and decided to rifle off as many songs as we could in a few hours. First, we thought of a handful of drum beats and laid those down and slowly built the songs around that. We both play drums bass and guitar.</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2424768229/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://pneumatictube.bandcamp.com/album/pneumatic-tube">Pneumatic Tube by Pneumatic Tube</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://pneumatictube.bandcamp.com/album/pneumatic-tube" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Pneumatic Tube @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Pneumatic Tube&#39;s of course not the only outlet for the TV Freaks members. It joins the ensemble <a href="https://sweetdave.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sweet Dave and the Shallow Graves</a>, who released and toured behind <em>Mental Jails</em> earlier in the year. Three-quarters of TV Freaks and vocalist Angie Lanza have been performing as <a href="https://theeuncontrollableurge.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Uncontrollable Urge</a> at shows around Southern Ontario. That group just finished recording their debut record, which we should hear something from soon. Freaks bassist Kevin Bell also recently released a solo set under the name <a href="https://glitteringprizesband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Glittering Prizes</a>. Like everything from this family, it&#39;s short, fast, loud and a little off-kilter.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3028539184/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://glitteringprizesband.bandcamp.com/album/glittering-prizes-ep">Glittering Prizes EP by Glittering Prizes</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://glitteringprizesband.bandcamp.com/" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Glittering Prizes @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Side-projects aside, TV Freaks proper are hard at work on a new record.

The band should have some new stuff together for December, which will see them both open one of those big ticket Alexisonfire reunion gigs then burn down 2017 at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/125834558086235/" class="" target=_blank>This Ain&#39;t Hollywood</a> for a New Years gig with Daniel Romano&#39;s Ancient Shapes and Ian Kehoe.</p><h2 class=generic>Of Note</span></h2><p>Winnipeg post-punk band <a href="https://1971canada.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>1971</a> have released a video for the song &quot;Anxiety (In the Depths of Northwestern Ontario),&quot; which will stand as one of the band&#39;s final recordings. The group decided to part ways in the wake of the death of their founding member and bassist <a href="http://yourlifemoments.ca/sitepages/obituary.asp?oid=1005368" class="" target=_blank>Cameron Glen Cranston</a>. He passed away unexpectedly earlier this year in Thunder Bay at the age of 25. The band commented on the track:</p><blockquote><p>We as a band decided to not continue without our brother. Now we’re releasing our last existing recordings with Cameron; two demos we recorded for a grant we received and one of his songs.</p><p>The first track “Anxiety (In the Depths of Northwestern Ontario)” was written for Cam in 2016 during a really difficult period while Cam was still around. We’re glad we have “his” song, even though it’s hard to listen to sometimes.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Anxiety&quot; was recorded and Mixed by J Riley Hill of <a href="http://mortfell.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Mortfell Recording</a>. These final three songs will be released through the <a href="https://www.artoftheuncarvedblock.com/" class="" target=_blank>Art of the Uncarved Block</a> label on December 1. The EP will be titled <em>No Matter Where You Go, There You Are.</em> The label&#39;s planning to release it as a double cassette which will include the band&#39;s entire discography (they last released an EP in 2016 titled <em>Burning Bridges Before They&#39;re Crossed</em>). 1971 had been active since 2011.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 gesture=media allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z60JbKRCG18?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z60JbKRCG18" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: 1971 - &quot;Anxiety (In the Depths of Northwestern Ontario)&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Colin Gillespie, the bassist of the Toronto noise-punk band <a href="https://greys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Greys</a>, has released a new full length as <a href="https://crgillespie.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>C.R. Gillespie</a> titled <em>Séance Works</em>. The album&#39;s a set of nine experimental ambient soundscapes which become quite haunting and beautiful as they unfold (the final song on the record clocks in at a weighty 20 minutes as well). A high-bias cassette release of the album, individually hand numbered and limited to 50, is available through the <a href="http://www.hereticalobjects.com/" class="" target=_blank>Heretical Objects Cooperative</a>. While I can certainly get into this type of thing, it&#39;s not quite a style I&#39;m familiar enough to describe, so let&#39;s default back to the press release:</p><blockquote><p>Delving further into their non-verbal tendencies, C.R. Gillespie has crafted a new makeshift-ambient effort, &quot;Séance Works&quot;. Inspired by the actively mesmerizing synth-work of Suzanne Ciani, the spacious intimacy of Gigi Masin, and the valued stillness of Brian Eno, his environment-as-instrument ethos demonstrates a surrealistic collapse of space, forming the pulse upon which melody expires like vapour. A fascination with the fragility of the recorded sound; a study in genesis, sustain and decay in modern technology.</p></blockquote><p>As they&#39;re between records I&#39;ve not had much to say yet about Greys in the lifespan of this newsletter, but they&#39;re one of my favourite rock bands in the country. Their last album, 2016&#39;s <em>Outer Heaven</em>, was accompanied a half year later by a companion set of tape-drones, repurposed audio, and assorted outtake oddities titled <em>Warm Shadow</em>. Knowing that <em>Séance Works</em> could result from a member of that family gives <em>Warm Shadow</em>&#39;s atmospherics a little more context. It really makes you wonder what weird and wonderful directions Greys could go with their sound whenever they return.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2984399029/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://hereticalobjects.bandcamp.com/album/seance-works">Seance Works by C.

Music rarely finds me through that nebulous sense of ambient awareness that social media&#39;s supposed to provide. Whenever it seems like everyone&#39;s talking about a new band, chances are it&#39;s not for me. There&#39;s a great deal I stumble upon through looking up the openers of shows or digging through the archives of some blog I trust.</p><p class=image><img src="/images/articles/right_shitty.jpg" alt="Right Shitty"/></p><p>So to give credit where it&#39;s due, I first ran into Saint John, New Brunswick&#39;s <a href="https://rightshitty.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Right Shitty</a> while tearing through the archives of the venerable <a href="https://weirdcanada.com/" class="" target=_blank>Weird Canada</a>. Somewhere among that day&#39;s sea of obscure tape drones and flowery bilingual prose I ran into a gritty little punk rock band that sounds both familiar yet vital. 2016&#39;s full length <em>Bachelor Of Arts</em> (<a href="https://monopolizedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Monopolized</a>) makes the case that there&#39;s plenty of gas left in the tank for gruff hardcore of the No Idea Records stripe. Yet unlike the acts that typify that Gainesville label, Right Shitty balances their louder moments not with melodic pop-punk but instead with lo-fi grunge. Pavement&#39;s the lazy comparison. I was instantly taken with &quot;Best Buzz,&quot; which gallops towards a first-in-the-air chorus that&#39;s pretty much cynic proof.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=427801072/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=208060129/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://rightshitty.bandcamp.com/album/bachelor-of-arts-2">Bachelor of Arts by Right Shitty</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p>It looks like the fine people of Saint John feel the same. &quot;Best Buzz&quot; and <em>Bachelor of Arts</em> recently took home the top honours for Song and Album at the Best of Saint John Music Awards, thrown by the campus and community radio station <a href="http://localfm.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Local 107.3FM</a>.</p><p>A week prior, I had the opportunity to help the band launch a few new songs at <a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/63924/media-right-shitty-henry-lee-lucas-crackd-out-punknews-exclusive" class="" target=_blank>Punknews.org</a>. &quot;Henry Lee Lucas&quot; and &quot;Crack’d Out&quot; land on the heavier end of the spectrum. They&#39;re mixed and mastered by Monopolized&#39;s Corey Bonnevie and appear in a video by Saint John filmmakers Mike Roy and Nick LeBlanc (the pair recently completed a local music scene documentary titled <a href="http://www.gridcitymagazine.com/out-of-the-fog-quality-block-party/" class="" target=_blank>In the Brick: A Quality Block Party</a>).</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=1280 height=720 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ddia8o8Rp9A?rel=0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p>I keep thinking about where I found Right Shitty, if for no other reason the band explicitly asked me, and I found that funny at the time. I listed <em>Bachelor of Arts</em> in my year end write-up on Punknews and word somehow got to the group. I absolutely got the sense that, while they were happy for the recognition, they were somewhat surprised I had run into them at all. Credit goes to Weird of course, but I keep thinking about publications like theirs and the service that it provides artists. I&#39;ve been in the PR-driven news cycle for so long that these more esoteric channels of discovery feel downright magical at times.</p><h2 class=generic>Safe Harbour</span></h2><p>University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist provided some <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2017/05/music-industrys-canadian-copyright-reform-goal-end-tech-companies-safe-harbours/" class="" target=_blank>commentary</a> this week on a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MusicCanada/videos/vb.140246729361512/1473078872744951/?type=2&amp;theater" class="" target=_blank>speech</a> by Miranda Mulholland of <a href="http://www.greatlakeswimmers.com/" class="" target=_blank>Great Lake Swimmers</a> and <a href="http://www.roaringgirlrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Roaring Girl Records</a> to the Economic Club of Canada. While praising Mulholland&#39;s passionate, personal talk Dr. Geist takes some time to unpack the concept of &quot;safe harbours&quot; in the Canadian context. Mulholland and the wider industry (her speech was broadcast by of the trade organization Music Canada) have been making the case that the government should legislate an end to them.</p><p>In the States the safe harbor provisions have allowed a user-generated content platform like YouTube to avoid legal responsibility for the uploading of unlicensed content. The service has to either remove infringing content upon request, or provide some form of compensation to the rightsholders, and this keeps matters out of the courts. The industry believes that by forcing Google (and everyone else) to be liable for infringement, ultimately more money for licensing will flow to the artists.</p><p>Dr. Geist&#39;s angle is interesting in that he attempts to untangle the assumptions on how much of the US safe harbour provisions are actually mirrored in Canadian law. The big surprise for me was that there&#39;s no legislated notice-and-takedown style system in Canada at all. Both Dr. Geist&#39;s break down of the legal specificities and Mulholland&#39;s perspective are absolutely worth your time.</p><h2 class=generic>Of Note</span></h2><p><a href="http://warrenkinsella.com/" class="" target=_blank>Warren Kinsella</a> has previewed a rough cut of a new song titled &quot;GPS&quot; from his self-described &quot;geriatric punk rock group&quot; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sfhpunks/" class="" target=_blank>Shit From Hell</a>.

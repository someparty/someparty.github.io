The group features Lawton performing with Priya Thomas (who&#39;s played solo both under her own name and as <a href="https://iroquoisfalls.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Iroquois Falls</a>), Mark Streeter of <a href="https://dorotheapaas.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dorothea Paas</a>, and Matt Nish-Lapidus of <a href="https://severalfutures.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Several Futures</a>, along with Ronnie Tee and Marc Holmes. There&#39;s a single published song to the band&#39;s name at the moment, titled &quot;Culture War Donner Party.&quot; Here&#39;s what the band had to say about in on Bandcamp:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;this song is a critique of: <a href="http://exclaim.ca/music/article/this_is_torontopia" class="" target=_blank>Torontopia</a>, big business indie, and about how I would kill to be involved in it. I&#39;ve also been thinking about a listicle I read about the Donner party, where someone murdered two people to eat when trapped in the Sierra Nevada Mountains during one of the most brutal winters on record. One of the members murdered another member in self defense and was then was banished and I mean… I GET THAT.</p><p>Eat me.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>I exist outside the Canadian independent music establishment, both geographically and because I&#39;m a long-time musical dilettante with an unrelated day job. As such the inner workings of the industry and the personalities that comprise it are more of a curiosity to me than something I can claim any first-hand experience with. That said, Lawton&#39;s <a href="http://www.canadalandshow.com/podcast/canadian-music-horribly-broken-week/" class="" target=_blank>ire-raising</a> questioning of the music <em>system</em> in Canada appeals to me, if for no other reason than it satisfies some convention-questioning punk rock part of my brain. I&#39;m skeptical on reflex, and I question how much I&#39;m being sold by entrenched interests even as I enjoy the fruits of that system. The sentiment expressed in the above song description certainly gives me pause.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=126357830/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://dontbothermusic.bandcamp.com/track/culture-war-donner-party">Culture War Donner Party by Don't Bother</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://dontbothermusic.bandcamp.com/track/culture-war-donner-party" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Don&#39;t Bother - &quot;Culture War Donner Party&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Don&#39;t Bother makes their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/132069460741631/" class="" target=_blank>live debut</a> in Toronto this fall, where they&#39;ll open for Atlanta&#39;s Omni with the Sulks on November 9th at Smiling Buddha.</p><h2 class=generic>Of Note</span></h2><p>Speaking of bands that&#39;ll debut soon, So Sensitive is set to play their first show next month, opening for Vancouver&#39;s <a href="https://jayarner.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jay Arner</a> with <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a> and Steve&#39;s Job (the Ottawa band formerly known as Sally Ride).

They were previously announced as headliners of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lifeanddeathtour/" class="" target=_blank>Life &amp; Death Tour</a> and have finally announced a new full-length. <em>Torture Culture</em> will be the band&#39;s first long player since 2004&#39;s <em>Suffer, Survive</em> and will the first since frontman Ben Cook refocused his creative energies on <a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a> and his various solo projects. The single &quot;In The City&quot; finds the group focused back on crowd-pleasing, mosh-ready hardcore. Cook described the band&#39;s approach to <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2017/08/24/no-warning-in-the-city-torture-culture" class="" target=_blank>The Fader</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We have attempted to express the condition of the human mind that is an outcome of being brainwashed by corporate controlled social media, through a modern and classic feeling hardcore album. Kind of like the scene in Clockwork Orange, when Alex has the lid locks over his eyes and is being forced to watch horrific footage over and over again. We are trying to manifest that torturous feeling; that in a time like this even if you want to look away you cant escape the propagandized media, especially amidst the thick of an overpopulated garbage pumping world. The evolution we have experienced both mentally and physically, and the day-to-day panic and anxiety that we feel is actually a result of our own species&#39; selfish and repulsive impulses.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Torture Culture</em> arrives on October 13th via <a href="http://www.badactorsinc.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bad Actors, Inc.</a> and <a href="https://lastgang.com/" class="" target=_blank>Last Gang</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=166 scrolling=no frameborder=no data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/338872722&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false" class=lazyload></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/badactorsinc/no-warning-in-the-city" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: No Warning - &quot;In The City&quot; @ SoundCloud</a></p><p>Hamilton alt-country act <a href="https://www.elliottbrood.com/" class="" target=_blank>Elliott BROOD</a> have released another track from their upcoming fifth full-length. &quot;Dig A Little Hole&quot; will appear on <em>Ghost Gardens</em> when it arrives on September 15th via <a href="https://paperbagrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Paper Bag</a>.

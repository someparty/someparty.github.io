We were in the habit of churning more than a dozen stories a day, and the post-holiday news doldrums felt simply excruciating for their lack of momentum. I&#39;m older now, arguably wiser, and (like everyone) ground quite thoroughly down by the sorry state of the world. At Some Party speeds, in a pandemic funk, I relished the break - but inertia&#39;s pernicious. Monday seemed a little thin still, but what a difference a few days can make. This is a big one.</p><h3 id=apollo_ghosts><span class=artist-title><a href="https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Apollo Ghosts</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Spilling Yr Guts&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/ob0DjZO-E3U" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/album/pink-tiger-2" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Adrian Teacher&#39;s issued several records since <a href="https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Apollo Ghosts</a> called it a career in 2013 - both as the funky <a href="https://thenameofthisbandiscool.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>COOL TV</a> and later <a href="https://adrianteacher.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Adrian Teacher &amp; the Subs</a>. While the latter struck close to the Vancouver band&#39;s scrappy jangle pop, Teacher didn&#39;t resume using the name until <em>Living Memory</em>, a sombre exploration of death and loss built from piano-driven instrumentals. While deeply personal for Teacher, it must have thrown fans for a bit of a loop. The pandemic, of course, took any further steam out of the band&#39;s return to action, with Teacher spinning the idle time into <em>Local Delivery Only</em>, a collection of covers celebrating Vancouver artists. Perhaps true to its title, it&#39;s no longer available if you didn&#39;t grab it at the time. As reunions go, this has been a slow, curious burn.</p><p>So while it&#39;s not unheralded, the news of a proper new full-length and the true successor to 2012&#39;s <em>Landmark</em> feels nonetheless momentous. <em>Pink Tiger</em> arrives on March 11 through <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed</a> - and it makes up for the lost time by landing as a gatefold double LP. The album sports a thematic split between its platters, with the A and B sides of <em>Pink</em> described as &quot;an intimate home-recorded acoustic-based cycle that grapples with loss, illness, death, and memory.&quot; Its <em>Tiger</em> counterpart amps things up with &quot;an exuberant indie-garage rock celebration of the persistence of friendship, music, and hope.&quot; That sounds pretty damn appealing to me.</p><p>The announcement arrived alongside &quot;Spilling Yr Guts,&quot; the lead track from the <em>Tiger</em> platter. You can stream it now or see it featured in a video by director <a href="https://www.derekjanzen.info/" class="" target=_blank>Derek Janzen</a>.</p><p>Apollo Ghosts recorded with Jordan Koop (Dumb, The Courtneys) at the Noise Floor, with additional production and mixing from David Carswell (Destroyer, New Pornographers) at JC/DC. The band recorded as a three-piece in the studio, with longtime drummer Amanda P. and bassist Robbie N. backing Teacher (on guitar, vocals, piano, and more). The group&#39;s future live lineup expands to a quartet, with Amanda picking up a guitar and Dustin B. cycling in on drums.</p><p>Teacher shared a statement on the record&#39;s creation, revealing some of the emotional forces and musical forebears influencing the work:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;About seven years ago, I stood around a makeshift fire pit in a clearing on a small gulf island with a group of my best friends. We burned a beer can and made jokes. When I started recording the first half of this record, I thought everything was falling apart. For six months, I could only hear from one ear and the doctor said it could be something quite serious. The cedars were still dying. My dad was still dying.</p><p>A year later, we recorded the second half of the record on Gabriola Island. My ear finally cleared up after the sessions were over. We listened to the final masters in the middle of the heat dome summer during the Perseid meteor shower. The heat dome eventually ended. In the fall, Amanda and I planted dozens of trees (Garry oaks, willows, alders and maples) around that fire pit. Our bass player Robbie&#39;s having a baby this spring. Amanda&#39;s started restoring hand-crank sewing machines. She says everything can be mended. It might be too late, but I&#39;m going to keep planting trees every year going forward anyways.</p><p>Apollo Ghosts joked that this was a feeble attempt at making our own &#39;Tusk&#39;. Some influences this round: The Bats, Dear Nora, Little Wings, Tom T. Hall, The La&#39;s, Beverly Glenn Copeland, disco beats, ocean swims, trees, Lucia Berlin &amp; Lydia Davis, and as always... the local music scene.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob0DjZO-E3U" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=solitude><span class=artist-title><a href="https://solitde.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Solit端de</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Pils Sessions</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/_e8d3nqh9ZI" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://pilssessions.bandcamp.com/album/solit-de-session-06-10-21" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>It should be evident to longtime subscribers that I&#39;m fascinated with the connective tissue spanning the country&#39;s artistic islands, and in that spirit, the <a href="https://pilssessions.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Pils Sessions</a> provides an essential service. The Gatineau studio and label&#39;s chronicling a fascinating crop of young bands from both the capital region and Quebec&#39;s punk scenes. Their latest project highlights Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://solitde.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Solit端de</a>, a new goth duo featuring Janick and Pask of the UK82 bruisers <a href="https://fractured3.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Fractured</a>. The band recorded their Pils set, the sixth in the series, back in October. Both &quot;Nations Under Dust&quot; and &quot;Cold Mist&quot; trade in bleak, danceable deathrock that fans of west coast new wavers ACTORS and Spectres will surely dig.</p><p>Chany Pilote engineered the performance at Pils&#39; NOMANSLAND studio, with Dizz Hup辿 producing visuals. You can find their video for &quot;Nations Under Dust&quot; at YouTube. Solit端de commented on their origins, rooted, like so much of today&#39;s art, in the ongoing health crisis:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It all started at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, I was (Pask) bored and just writing a bunch of music alone and tried to do a solo project, and Janick came in one night for a drink and heard my songs and asked me to sing on it. There it is. Solit端de for both a side project but also a solid project based on friendship.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://fractured3.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Fractured</a>-proper recorded their Pils session last summer.

Last week <a href="https://monopolizedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Monopolized Records</a> issued <em>Season 2</em> of the project, featuring a series of collaborations between East Coast artists. These 12 songs arise from three separate recording sessions in the Fall of 2021, marking the project&#39;s return to action after nearly five years of dormancy. The new release pairs Fredericton rock group <a href="https://mariantheband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Marian</a> with Saint John&#39;s folky <a href="https://toothandthefang.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Tooth &amp; the Fang</a>, recorded at the Shiftwork studio.

The track fits well (with a dispassionate shrug, of course) alongside earlier earworms &quot;Ice Cream Cone&quot; and &quot;Drip.&quot; The complete set&#39;s due April 1, but I need no further convincing. This may turn out to be one of the highlights of the year.</p><p><em>Downward Dog</em> arrives as the follow-up to No Frills&#39; 2018 debut EP <em>Nice To Meet You</em>. That record saw Daniel Busheikin (of <a href="https://grounders.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Grounders</a>) establish the band&#39;s relaxingly downtrodden outlook, backed by his fellow Grounder Kelvin Grove, Jon Pappo (of <a href="https://hoodedfang.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hooded Fang</a> and <a href="https://whimm.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>WHIMM</a>), and Matt &#39;Bucky&#39; Buckberrough (who&#39;s played with <a href="https://www.twistofficial.com/" class="" target=_blank>Twist</a> and <a href="https://bedss.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Beds</a>).</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=299409624/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://nofrillsmusic.bandcamp.com/track/i-dont-wanna-be-your-dog-anymore-single">I Don't Wanna Be Your Dog Anymore (Single) by No Frills</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=matt_ellis><span class=artist-title><a href="https://mattellis333.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Matt Ellis</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Everything Sucks</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://mattellis333.bandcamp.com/album/everything-sucks" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>I caught a small but meaningful handful of shows during those few months of hope before Omicron hit. The <a href="https://mattellis333.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Matt Ellis</a> Band took the honour of serving as the first live performance I had the pleasure of seeing since March of 2020. So if I wasn&#39;t already an uncritical booster of Matt&#39;s gleefully shameless Ramones revivalism, I&#39;m now hopelessly biased in his favour. On that note, <em>Everything Sucks</em> is everything you want it to be, bringing two new cuts of sneering, home-recorded punk rock, each a minute in length. If you&#39;re looking for an insight into Matt&#39;s current mood, the EP features songs titled &quot;Brutal Planet&quot; and &quot;Everything Sucks / I Hate It All&quot; - no ambiguity there (no argument either).</p><p>Last fall, Matt released a killer full-length of quarantine rockers titled <em>Full Moon Fever</em>, issued on vinyl through Italy&#39;s <a href="http://surfinkirecords.bigcartel.com/" class="" target=_blank>Surfin&#39; Ki Records</a>. When the world finally starts turning again, Matt presumably still sings and plays guitar for the Hamilton proto-punk revivalists <a href="https://fleshrag.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Flesh Rag</a> and Toronto&#39;s <a href="http://weareplasticheads.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>PlasticHeads</a>.

The label&#39;s new double LP collects both the band&#39;s 14-song 1996 debut and includes the entirety of its unreleased follow-up (unofficially titled <em>Headfuls of Chills</em>). All-in, 2022&#39;s self-titled <em>Salmonblaster</em> clocks in with 25 songs, including the group&#39;s attention-grabbing single &quot;Freeway,&quot; a barnburner of a song that earned some Much Music attention back in the day (not that I noticed).</p><p>Active during the 90s punk revival from 1994 through 1998, Salmonblaster featured vocalist/guitarist Matt Werm, drummer Brady Parr, and bassist Mat Davis.

The Vancouver singer-songwriter returns to his oft-challenging and densely poetic solo vehicle <a href="https://destroyer.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Destroyer</a> in March, with a new LP <em>Labyrinthitis</em> due through <a href="https://www.mergerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Merge Records</a>. Clocking as the artist&#39;s 13th full-length under the name, the album arrives with ten new songs, including the synth-driven lead single &quot;Tintoretto, It&#39;s for You.&quot; Bejar commented on the piece, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I had an idea of writing a couple lines on the idea of &#39;mystery&#39; and &#39;goin nowhere,&#39; as they are two of my favourite themes. That and the Grim Reaper and being pursued by some silent, unnamable thing that constantly lurks one foot to the left of you. Especially as the world&#39;s decay becomes increasingly less abstract. Also wanted to write on the romance of terror. The song &#39;Tintoretto, It&#39;s for You&#39; speaks to all these things, oddly enough so does the video...&quot;</p></blockquote><p>On that topic, director David Galloway revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It hopefully presents some loose giallo vibes despite the fact that it clearly isn&#39;t a giallo at all. Nobody dies, nothing is explored at length, and it&#39;s ultimately a collection of neighbourhood red herrings. All leads that go nowhere. But that&#39;s the mystery. That&#39;s the mystery about music videos.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new record follows 2020&#39;s <em>Have We Met</em> and Bejar&#39;s aforementioned anniversary shows with the Porns. Presuming we turn a corner on <em>the problem</em> by then, check your local listings for April tour dates in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and throughout the States. <em>Labyrinthitis</em> arrives March 25.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6W41ClvHmWY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2022-01-24-show-your-children/" rel=next title="Next article: Show Your Children"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Show Your Children</div> <div class=pagination-date>January 24, 2022</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2021-12-28-rock-n-roll/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Rock n&#x27; Roll"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Rock n' Roll</div> <div class=pagination-date>December 28, 2021</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

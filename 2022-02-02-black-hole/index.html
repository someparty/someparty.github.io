With a cursory search, I can see him mentioned as a member of the Calgary indie rock troop <a href="https://ghostkeeper.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ghostkeeper</a> and credited on the lovely 2020 LP from Edmonton&#39;s <a href="https://marlaenamoore.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Marlaena Moore</a>. That I missed Bourne&#39;s 2021 singles (April&#39;s &quot;Hopeless&#39; and September&#39;s &quot;Wasted World&quot;) is an unfortunate oversight on my part (especially given how propulsively weird the latter is - just an absolutely <a href="https://ryanbourne.bandcamp.com/track/wasted-world" class="" target=_blank>on-brand</a> Some Party tune if there ever was one). This week, the artist returns with the psych rocker &quot;Black Hole,&quot; the latest in a series of studio collaborations with alt-folk icon <a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chad VanGaalen</a> and Calgary super-connector Chris Dadge (<a href="https://labcoast.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lab Coast</a>/<a href="http://alvvays.com/" class="" target=_blank>Alvvays</a>). For years Bourne and Dadge have served as VanGaalen&#39;s sometimes-backing band The Bleach Wipes, so it&#39;s no surprise how well everyone clicks here. On &quot;Black Hole,&quot; Bourne sings while covering guitar, bass, and keyboards, Dadge plays drums and cello, and VanGaalen handles synths and backing vocals.</p><p>Bourne commented in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Black Hole&#39; is a kind of sensual satire set to a post-punk bounce. I was messing around with three-chord pop feels on guitar, and the melody felt really &#39;80s, so the synth hooks took &#39;80s baroque pop and dream pop cues, and the lyric took shape as a kind of metaphysical dystopian daydream.</p><p>Waning attention spans in a &#39;Black Hole&#39; of apocalypse anxiety, pandemic isolation, climate change and nuclear threat... information saturation, the vacuum of technified modernity... but human contact being made nonetheless, and a kind of sexy, non-binary, spiritual illumination realizing itself in spite of the trouble we appear to be in.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The eventual home for these new songs appears to be an upcoming LP titled <em>Plant City</em>. There&#39;s no confirmed release date yet, but I wager you&#39;ll see it by the spring.</p><p>&quot;Black Hole&quot; arrives alongside a video directed by Bourne and Rebecca Reid. It includes footage of several Treaty 7 art installations, including a Katie Ohe sculpture in Bankview, the Contemporary Calgary gallery, and the Maillot Homes Art Castle.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSbvjBcDCqo" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=tess_parks><span class=artist-title><a href="https://www.tessparks.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tess Parks</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Happy Birthday Forever&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/k_-hFR46b0w" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://tessparks.bandcamp.com/track/happy-birthday-forever" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Psych-pop singer-songwriter <a href="https://www.tessparks.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tess Parks</a> recently announced <em>And Those Who Were Seen Dancing</em>, a new full-length due May 20 through <a href="https://fuzzclub.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fuzz Club</a> and <a href="https://www.handdrawndracula.com" class="" target=_blank>Hand Drawn Dracula</a>. The Toronto-born artist, now based in London, shared the news alongside the gospel-influenced &quot;Happy Birthday Forever.&quot; In a press release Parks commented on the single and the difficult path to the record&#39;s completion:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In my mind, this album is like hopscotch. These songs were pieced together over time in London, Toronto and Los Angeles with friends and family between August 2019 and March 2021. So many other versions of these songs exist. The recording and final completion of this album took over two years and wow - the lesson I have learned the most is that words are spells. If I didn&#39;t know it before, I know it now for sure. I only want to put good out into the universe.</p><p>I really felt discouraged to complete this album. I stopped listening to music for honestly about a year altogether and turned to painting instead. I really had to convince myself again that it&#39;s important to just share whatever good we can - having faith in ourselves to know that our lights can shine on and on through other people and for other people. The thought of anyone not sharing their art or being shy of anything they create seems like a real tragedy to me. Even if it&#39;s not perfect, you&#39;re capturing a moment.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new album&#39;s the long-awaited follow-up to Parks&#39; acclaimed 2013 full-length <em>Blood Hot</em>. It&#39;s her first solo record since a pair of collaborative LPs with Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The intergenerational duo issued <em>I Declare Nothing</em> in 2015 and the self-titled <em>Tess Parks &amp; Anton Newcombe</em> in 2018.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_-hFR46b0w" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=klazo><span class=artist-title><a href="https://klazo.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Klazo</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Nobody Can Tell Us&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://klazo.bandcamp.com/track/nobody-can-tell-us-pack-1978" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Two-piece London punk bruisers <a href="https://klazo.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Klazo</a> return next week with the <em>&#39;Demik Dementia</em> LP, a set they&#39;re previewing with a raucous cover of &quot;Nobody Can Tell Us&quot; (originally by the first-wave Munich punk trio PACK).

Doiron commented on the track in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Mayo&#39; is a day like many days in our little house in New Brunswick... And while it seems we are just singing of things like mayonnaise and carrots, we are mostly singing of the ups and downs and all the moments in between.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new record reflects the monotony of life during the stay-at-home orders, written and recorded from the real-life couple&#39;s respective homes during the slow grind of the pandemic.</p><p>Doiron and Placard worked together on the recent <em>I Thought of You</em> in early 2020, teaming with Welland, Ontario brothers Ian and <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a> in the studio. That record arrived last November through <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>.

As we explored a few weeks ago, the record presents a dichotomy between its two platers, and this track provides our first preview of the collection&#39;s gentler side. You&#39;ve Changed earlier described the A and B sides of <em>Pink Tiger</em> as &quot;an intimate home-recorded acoustic-based cycle that grapples with loss, illness, death, and memory.&quot; We&#39;re told the C and D side roar back with &quot;an exuberant indie-garage rock celebration of the persistence of friendship, music, and hope.&quot; Slotted in as the first track on that gentler A side, &quot;Pink Tiger&quot; has the label exclaiming: &quot;This one&#39;s for the flower-punks!&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a striking counterpart to &quot;Spilling Yr Guts,&quot; the lead rocker from the plugged-in half that we previewed in January.</p><p>Lisa Marr of the Vancouver cuddlecore legends <a href="http://www.cubisaband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Cub</a> directed the &quot;Pink Tiger&quot; video alongside Paolo Davanzo. Notably, the filmmakers processed the clip&#39;s 8mm film using a tea of flowers and organics sourced from the garden at <a href="http://www.echoparkfilmcenter.org/blog/epfc-north/" class="" target=_blank>Echo Park Film Centre North</a>.</p><p>Apollo Ghosts recorded with Jordan Koop (Dumb, The Courtneys) at the Noise Floor, with additional production and mixing provided by David Carswell (Destroyer, New Pornographers) at JC/DC. The band recorded as a three-piece in the studio, with longtime drummer Amanda P. and bassist Robbie N. backing Teacher (on guitar, vocals, piano, and more). The group&#39;s future live lineup expands to a quartet, with Amanda picking up a guitar and Dustin B. cycling in on drums. The new record arrives following 2019&#39;s slow-burning instrumental <em>Living Memory</em> and marks Apollo Ghosts&#39; first outing as a full band since 2012&#39;s <em>Landmark</em>. <em>Pink Tiger</em> arrives on March 11 through <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GdlafYPmBQ4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=bratboy><span class=artist-title><a href="https://bratboy.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Bratboy</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Dream Rope&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/fRSLazm8XmY" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://bratboy.bandcamp.com/track/dream-rope" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Last week the emergent Vancouver punk act <a href="https://bratboy.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Bratboy</a> issued &quot;Dream Rope,&quot; the second preview from an upcoming full-length the band also recorded with Jordan Koop.

The announcement landed alongside &quot;Bye Bye Baby,&quot; which follows the infectious &quot;Julia&quot; and &quot;Better Each Day&quot; in previewing the 7-song set.</p><p>The new track is notably the first that guitarist/vocalist Karolane Carbonneau wrote for the group. She reveals:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;When I wrote that song, I was having the worst breakup of my life. Kathryn, the lead singer of our band, said to me &#39;you should take advantage of your sadness to write a freaking badass song.&#39; I&#39;ve always wanted to sing lead vocals on a song, but I never got the guts to do it. Props to Kathryn for the support and forcing me to do it! And please, do yourself a favour and never let anyone bring you down.

From its pulsing power pop beginning it swerves through melancholy soundscapes to end on optimistic bursts of distorted guitar. Rebellion infiltrates the rest of the album through field recordings, finger snaps, stand-up bass, crazed laughter and a live one-handed guitar frenzy...&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can hear the complete work now at Bandcamp.

With that record still fresh, the group&#39;s unveiled their first follow-up single - a one-off titled &quot;Shades of Grey.&quot; Singer/guitarist Tom McGreevy shared a bit on the track&#39;s history:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song is actually one of the oldest in our catalog. We wrote it around the same time as <em>Get Bleak</em>, or maybe a little bit after, and played it live a bunch, but never quite finished it. We kept poking at it for a long time until we finally got it to where we wanted it to be, which happened during the Modern Fiction sessions. We ended up leaving it off the record as it didn&#39;t quite thematically fit with the other songs, but I&#39;m excited we&#39;re finally getting to put it out as I&#39;ve always liked it. It&#39;s about the inertia of depression, and how hard it can be to break out of those cycles, but also about the pleasure of embracing that state. There is a certain, temporary comfort to be found in the abyss! Somewhere right before it inevitably becomes extremely awful.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new song arrived alongside news of the band&#39;s spring tour dates supporting Brooklyn&#39;s Nation of Language and a rescheduled UK routing for the fall.</p><p>Ducks Ltd. records as a duo featuring Tom McGreevy (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) and Evan Lewis (guitar, bass, drum programming). <em>Modern Fiction</em>, the band&#39;s first LP, arrived in the fall via <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain</a> and <a href="http://carparkrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Carpark Records</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xv30clRqfuc" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=pasmort><span class=artist-title><a href="https://pasmort.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>PasMort</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Denis le Vampire&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/thuUT93Zsqs" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://pasmort.bandcamp.com/track/denis-le-vampire" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>During the pandemic shutdown, members of Quebec punk groups <a href="https://atreeatlast.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>A Tree At Last</a>, <a href="https://albatrosqc.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Albatros</a>, <a href="https://lostlove.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lost Love</a>, and <a href="https://striverqc.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Striver</a> came together as a new band dubbed <a href="https://pasmort.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>PasMort</a>.

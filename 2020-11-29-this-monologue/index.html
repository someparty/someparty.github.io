Of course, we&#39;ve seen COVID indiscriminately snatch the football from every artist this year, but I have the distinct sense that this amiable Toronto trio just can&#39;t catch a break. I present the following evidence.</p><p>After numerous missed gigs, I finally had my chance to see the pop-punk group play at Beau&#39;s Oktoberfest, only to have a tornado (the risk of one, anyway) quite literally pull the plug on their set 30 seconds into the first song. &quot;I Hate Men,&quot; Talk Show Host&#39;s 2018 single, upset the MRA beehive at the height of the regressive movement&#39;s moment in the cultural spotlight, garnering what I&#39;m certain was no shortage of unwelcome attention from the Internet&#39;s worst quarters.</p><p>The members of Talk Show Host have been incredibly supportive of this newsletter over the years, regularly sharing these missives through their various channels while asking for nothing in return. Unsurprisingly, given their luck, when big news from the band does arrive, it finds me lost in the pandemic malaise that&#39;s upended the weekly publishing rhythm I once strove for. It feels (unfortunately) fitting then that Talk Show Host must contend with the hell-year that is 2020 while unveiling their next record. Could 2021 be the year that turns things around?</p><p>Last week, the group announced that they&#39;ve signed with the L.A. punk label <a href="https://wiretaprecords.limitedrun.com/" class="" target=_blank>Wiretap Records</a> for their forthcoming full-length, joining a roster that includes Audio Karate and Spanish Love Songs. You can hear the first stand-alone single from the new era, titled &quot;This Monologue,&quot; below. Guitarist/vocalist Chris Veinot had this to say about the tune, which arrived alongside a very lockdown-aware video (that&#39;ll seem quite strange when this is all over):</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;This Monologue&#39; is about the annoying commentary track in your head that spends a good portion of every day telling you, in excruciating detail, about all the things you&#39;ve done wrong, are currently doing wrong, and are about to do wrong.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new recording finds Talk Show Host once again working with NQ Arbuckle&#39;s John Dinsmore (PUP, Great Lake Swimmers) at his Lincoln County Social Club studio. Dinsmore previously engineered the band&#39;s <em>Not Here To Make Friends</em> EP. The band&#39;s long-time collaborator Olive t&#39;Servrancx-Bierman mixed the new track from France.</p><p>Talk Show Host features guitarist/vocalist Chris Veinot, drummer Sean Woolven, and bassist Fabien Rivenet. Expect the band&#39;s Wiretap debut in the spring of 2021, if we survive that long.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4kmOOu-8_gk" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/4kmOOu-8_gk" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Talk Show Host - &quot;This Monologue&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Hamilton&#39;s <a href="https://mattellis333.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Matt Ellis</a>, vocalist and guitarist for proto-punk revivalists <a href="https://fleshrag.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Flesh Rag</a> and the Toronto punk outfit <a href="http://weareplasticheads.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>PlasticHeads</a>, recently shared the single &quot;My Neighbourhood is a Dump.&quot; The track arrives in support of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HammerCityRecords/" class="" target=_blank>Hammer City Records</a>, the hidden basement record store that serves as hub for Hamilton&#39;s punk scene. The shop is currently seeking a new home, with dual blows from the pandemic and a quickly gentrifying neighbourhood forcing it out of its old space. The video for &quot;Neighbourhood&quot; finds Ellis performing in the old store, capturing that endearing clutter for the ages. He commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Here is a video I made for the last weekend of Hammer City Records James Street location... I am sad we are getting the boot and I am bummed I won&#39;t get to hang there or play one last basement show. Fuck the new James Street and Eat the Rich. Long live H.C.R and here&#39;s looking forward to finding a new home.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track also serves as the first single from <em>Full Moon Fever</em>, a solo LP Ellis has lined up for a 2021 release from Italy&#39;s <a href="http://surfinkirecords.bigcartel.com/" class="" target=_blank>Surfin&#39; Ki Records</a>.</p><p>Throughout the spring and summer lockdown, Ellis released four home-recorded Ramones-worshiping EPs (<em>High Risk Assurance</em>, <em>Stays Home</em>, <em>Halfway to Insanity</em>, and <em>Never Was, Is And Never Shall Be</em>). With Flesh Rag, he issued the <em>Shit City - Demos and Unreleased</em> collection last month.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3-uEtNfjqE" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/B3-uEtNfjqE" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Matt Ellis - &quot;My Neighbourhood is a Dump&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>The chaotic Toronto snark-punks <a href="https://wlmrt.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>WLMRT</a> may have burnt up (or burnt out) at the end of last year, but its members remain close-knit and active, with several home-recorded projects emerging throughout the COVID lockdown. The latest is <a href="https://joggingisgoodforyou.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Jogging</a>, courtesy of guitarist Adam Bernhardt. That band debuted with a five-song self-titled EP, recorded over the course of the year. These songs find Bernhardt exploring a laid-back new wave sound, a perfect fit for his deadpan vocals (which take on a wonderfully goth quality here). You can pick the set up at Bandcamp now, with proceeds due for the Black Legal Action Centre.</p><p>Earlier this year, WLMRT vocalist Shelby Wilson re-emerged in <a href="http://onlygodforgivesto.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Only God Forgives</a>, a twitchy electronic duo with <a href="http://tallies.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Tallies</a>&#39; Stephen Pitman.

Last week new videos surfaced showcasing two of the EP&#39;s track. You can find &quot;Sex Genius&quot; by the Haligonian Booji Boys and &quot;Meathead&quot; from Charlottetown&#39;s Warsh below.</p><p>Sewercide had this to say about the long-awaited release, detailing some of the vinyl variants floating around:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Holy shit, is this thing finally out? It is!! The east coast of canada has always had a small, but active DIY punk community. In our eyes, the bands just seem to keep getting better with every passing year, so last year we decided a compilation record with a few of said bands was long overdue. In true Sewercide fashion, we decided to put together this short, sharp, shock of miserable maritime mutant music in 7&quot; form, with new and exclusive tracks from a few of our favourite bands from the area... this 7 track ep is a small offering of some of what is going on out here in the middle of nowhere. Limited to 300 copies, the record has been released with a few variants. Those who pre-ordered will receive the pre-order variant on brown paper with stamped dust sleeve, promo poster and obi-strip (limited to 66 copies), while the white sleeve variant will be the regular version. Black paper sleeve variant (limited to 20 copies) will not be sold, but is for all the punks who played on this record. This has taken a very, very long time to get released, so we are very pleased to finally have this out!&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qAtfjng-svM" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/qAtfjng-svM" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Warsh - &quot;Meathead&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0k3ASXCJfXw" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/0k3ASXCJfXw" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Booji Boys - &quot;Sex Genuis&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Abbotsford post-punk group <a href="http://www.blessedtheband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Blessed</a> has paired up with <a href="http://www.flemisheye.com/" class="" target=_blank>Flemish Eye</a> for a new EP, titled <em>iii</em>. The Calgary label had this to say about the record, due February 19:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;the EP&#39;s four tracks expand on Blessed&#39;s already-idiosyncratic vision: cavernous post-punk electronics and measured drum work pave under guitar-work that trips and sways from chiming and sunny, to serrated and snarling, to frigid and stiff.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can hear the set&#39;s first single, &quot;Structure,&quot; below. It arrived alongside an evocative and cinematic video from director Kaayla Whachell. The group commented on the track, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Structure&#39; deals with complacency and failing to explore the depths of your actions compared to the words you espouse and values you proclaim to have. If you can&#39;t acknowledge your imperfection and flaws, you don&#39;t leave room to listen and grow. If you&#39;re always trying to teach, you can&#39;t be taught.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new material follows Blessed&#39;s 2019 debut full length, <em>Salt</em>, and numerically follows their 2017 EP <em>II</em> (not to mention a split with the Winnipeg noise-punk group <a href="http://tunicband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tunic</a>).

I wanted to record some beats in 5/8 and track some bass on top. Figured I&#39;d add some guitar since I have one. Then I thought, a shaker would really get this going. Next thing you know I&#39;m singing on the dang thing.

Frontman Josh Hauta commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Most people would agree that 2020 has been a disaster of a year but in actuality 2019 was almost worse for me! I went through a dark time after college concluded and took a long break from music.</p><p>This song was the first thing I wrote as I came out of the darkness and as you will see, it&#39;s a bowl of gummy bears in terms of joyfulness.

The news came alongside the record&#39;s second single, &quot;Tried To Tell You.&quot; It&#39;s featured in a forest-set video that carries over the visual motif of the &quot;Robber&quot; single (tying into the album&#39;s cover art as well). In her newsletter, Lindeman commented on both the song and the visuals:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I&#39;ve always thought pop songs were really interesting, the way they move through spaces and people, the way that they can carry an idea or an emotion into places you might not expect it to be. Pop songs have always been a place where we allow subversive and passionate emotions to move through us, to show up in shopping malls and cars and political rallies. If a melody is clear enough, we&#39;ll forgive everything; we&#39;ll turn off our minds and let it in. So this is my (clumsy) attempt at writing a pop song. And of course, the feeling I wanted my pop song to carry into the world and through all these barriers was my desire for someone to be able to trust themselves, to be able to trust the most human, most soft, most mysterious part of themselves, which I know all too well is hard to do in this world. And it being a pop song, when I say &#39;someone&#39;, I really mean everyone.</p><p>The video portrays a person who is beset by miracles and visions of beauty, which emanate both from inside of him and from all around him, but rather than reacting with awe or joy, he reacts with annoyance, indifference, and mistrust. This is how many of us live under a vibrantly shifting and changing sky all day long and literally don&#39;t see it; this is also how we are taught not to see the natural world that we still live in, preferring instead to dwell on the artificial, which is so often a poor substitute for the vibrant real. I mean, flowers really do rise up from mud, and many of us are full of treasures and beauty, but we often discount these things or throw them away. All I really wanted to do was to show that. It&#39;s surprisingly uncomfortable to watch this video, to watch someone be so indifferent. But you can see the same thing any day of the week, if you just sit outside on the street and watch the people go by.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The Weather Station plans to usher the record into the world with a high-production-value ticketed live online performance on February 11. Tickets are <a href="https://noonchorus.com/the-weather-station/" class="" target=_blank>available now</a>. <em>Ignorance</em> follows the group&#39;s self-titled effort, which landed in 2017.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNaKbMnOgX4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/KNaKbMnOgX4" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: The Weather Station - &quot;Tried to Tell You&quot; @ YouTube</a></p> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2020-12-06-kick-it/" rel=next title="Next article: Kick It"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Kick It</div> <div class=pagination-date>December 6, 2020</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2020-11-15-back-with-the-gang/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Back With The Gang"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Back With The Gang</div> <div class=pagination-date>November 15, 2020</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

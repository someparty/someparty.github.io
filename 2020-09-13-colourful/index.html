I stretched my already nebulous concept of &quot;Sunday&quot; out longer than I should have and came crashing right into the next week&#39;s new music slate. How dare the nation&#39;s PR engines not play to the sorry beat of my lethargic drum?</p><p>As of now, there&#39;s <em>essential</em> new stuff out in the wild from Jennifer Castle, the Chandra band, Partner, the OBGMs, and a host of other notables. I&#39;ll catch up with all of that in the next edition, but you&#39;re encouraged to seek it out in the meantime. &quot;React to it at your leisure&quot; has been the unofficial slogan of this newsletter since the get-go, and this week I&#39;m leaning just a little too far into it for comfort.</p><hr/><p>Occasionally (which is to say, with a frequency that should be unsurprising given the above), I come across a blind spot in this newsletter&#39;s coverage that makes very little sense given my personal history. Somehow this year, I&#39;ve missed every single update from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/figurewalking/" class="" target=_blank>Figure Walking</a>, the Winnipeg duo featuring singer-songwriter <a href="http://gregmacpherson.com/" class="" target=_blank>Greg MacPherson</a> and drummer Rob Gardiner (Conduct, Pip Skid). My oversights usually don&#39;t trouble me, I&#39;m more aware than anyone of the precipitous sliver of free time on which Some Party operates, but I&#39;ve got history with MacPherson! I interviewed Greg as a university student in the early Punknews days, just before or after <em>Night Flares</em> came out on the G7 Welcoming Committee. I was deeply enamoured with the song &quot;Company Store&quot; and how that tense little protest tune mirrored my great grandfather&#39;s history in the Sydney mines. Furthermore, it was an early attempt at leveraging whatever clout Punknews had at the time to force the spotlight on something cool and Canadian. You could say the whole misguided quest of this newsletter had its roots in G7 fandom!</p><p>So with all that said, I have no idea how I lost track of Greg MacPherson.</p><p>Figure Walking&#39;s new record <em>Vertical/Horizontal</em> arrived last Friday from <a href="https://disintegrationrecords.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Disintegration Records</a>. The 10-song set is the duo&#39;s sophomore release under the name, showcasing MacPherson&#39;s impassioned personal/political storytelling backed by Gardiner&#39;s post-rock inspired percussion. The release came alongside a video for the album track &quot;Colourful,&quot; shot and edited by MacPherson on a cell phone this past September. The artist commented on the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;[Colourful] is a kind of weather report; projecting a bitter cold front ahead of vicious winds, heavy ice and freezing rains. There&#39;s a violent storm overhead, some of us are hiding under our houses or huddled near a load bearing wall but there are many who seem convinced against evidence that all will be well.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>MacPherson further explained the narrative presented in the &quot;Colourful&quot; video:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Three true believers navigate modernity and late stage capitalism, preparing themselves for a new world; one is a believer in science, the next religion, the third commerce. They grapple with over a hundred years of Winnipeg urban design and then square off with one another in a bizarre post-cultural dance-a-thon.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Figure Walking recorded <em>Vertical/Horizontal</em> in Montreal (at The Pines with Steve Bates) and Winnipeg (at Argyle Studios with Cam Loeppky). The record serves as Greg&#39;s 10th studio album as a principal songwriter and his fourth collaborating with Gardiner. Videos for the tracks &quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/VzbOjDeQ70k" class="" target=_blank>Mr. X</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/by-ErPE64Yc" class="" target=_blank>Last Dollar (Green July)</a>&quot; were shared in the run-up to the release (not that I shared anything about it). Figure Walking last released the Polaris long-listed <em>The Big Other</em> in 2017.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM55Yt74p7k" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/pM55Yt74p7k" class="black no-underline fw4 db tc f6 nt3 mb4" target=_blank>Watch: Figure Walking - &quot;Colourful&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto&#39;s genre-elusive garage-punks <a href="https://teenanger.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Teenanger</a> have the third preview of their upcoming <em>Good Time</em> LP online. The single &quot;Romance for Rent&quot; comes alongside a hilarious Jack Blair-directed video that finds drummer Steve Sidoli in a fraught and utterly unhealthy relationship with a pair of novelty pillows. There are few visual art pieces that so deftly capture the absurdities of isolation, particularly isolation with easy access to online mailorder.</p><p>Vocalist Chris Swimmings commented on the track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The lyrics were inspired by a friend of mine who had come out of a long-term relationship and was exploring the world of online dating. I&#39;ve been a serial monogamist for the last 12 years so it was a vicarious exploration into his life at the time.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Director Jack Blair echoed that sentiment:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The &#39;Romance for Rent&#39; video takes the idea of loneliness and buying love and puts it in a blender with internet culture. It follows a lonely man who, rather than learning how to connect with others, connects with a meme pillow, and finds some short-lived solace with it; he is trying to solve his loneliness with an internet search, and kinda clings to the first thing he finds - a celebrity pillow. When that fails to get him the attention or connection that he was looking for, he goes back online. Rather than changing anything about himself or what he&#39;s looking for, he just repeats the same cycle.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>I suspect the video&#39;s a better overall experience if you come into it cold, so I&#39;m not naming the celebrities involved. Enjoy.</p><p>Teenanger&#39;s sixth full-length, <em>Good Time</em> arrives October 2 via the band&#39;s longtime label <a href="https://www.telephoneexplosion.com/" class="" target=_blank>Telephone Explosion</a>.

The project materialized as a means to widdle away the quarantine hours, with the full record conceived, written, and recorded over the summer. From the press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Initially started as a means to kill time without killing their wallets in the very early days of 2020 quarantine, Cayley O&#39;Neill and Shawn Petsche spent a short Saturday afternoon writing a rock song that looked forward to time outside of their small Calgary apartment. As quarantine was extended, so too was the tradition of waking up Saturday morning and writing and recording a song before the sun went down, by themselves, for no one else but themselves. Before they knew it, they had an album&#39;s worth of material that they slowly admitted to themselves was &#39;actually pretty good. Maybe even really good?&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A video for the song &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; is online now, featuring animated wrestling footage entirely assembled within the <em>WWE 2K16</em> video game.

The 8-song cassette release on the <a href="https://industrialcoast.bigcartel.com/" class="" target=_blank>Industrial Coast</a> label features music entirely composed on (and cleverly manipulated from) a Barbie-branded <em>Jam With Me</em> toy keyboard found broken and abandoned on the road in Toronto.</p><p>Jax commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Every track on Pink was recorded with the Barbie keyboard I found in the trash. The plan was to make one song, then circuit bend the shit out of the hardware, but once I started to really listen to the instrument I realized there had to be a larger collection of songs and sounds.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The full write-up at Bandcamp details how Jax extracted some unintended sounds from the toy, describing &quot;static generated by wiggling the star-embedded volume knobs just right&quot; and &quot;feedback made by pointing the bendy green microphone at the speaker.&quot; The process is fascinating, with the resulting compositions often hypnotic and haunting (I completely lost track of writing this week&#39;s edition while listening to the closer &quot;Lavender&quot;).</p><p>Jax recorded <em>Pink</em> front to back during Toronto&#39;s COVID-19 lockdown.

The lushly orchestrated track certainly feels like a step up in production value from the Niagara-area folk artist. Burton commented on the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Further&#39; was written with the world&#39;s downward spiral in mind. We&#39;ve lost focus. Forgotten what matters. We are the world? But the world isn&#39;t us. I think we need to find out how to become equal parts earth and humanity without causing damage to one another. There&#39;s a balance in there somewhere.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The single premiered alongside a video from director <a href="https://www.immvproductions.com" class="" target=_blank>Justis Krar</a>.</p><p>The new material follows <em>The Mountain Man</em>, an album of children&#39;s songs the rural-minded Burton issued last year. The track serves as the proper follow-up to his 2017 full-length <em>Songs Of</em>. While he&#39;s several albums into a solo career writing rustic country and clever folk tunes, Burton&#39;s roots were in the much-loved Welland pop-punk band <a href="https://attackinblack.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Attack In Black</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ICCwRQ2MIKY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/ICCwRQ2MIKY" class="black no-underline fw4 db tc f6 nt3 mb4" target=_blank>Watch: Spencer Burton - &quot;Further&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>The <a href="https://abattoir-label.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Abattoir</a> label has collected the recent work of stark Haligonian coldwave group <a href="https://labise.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>La Bise</a>.

It&#39;s about how people present an idealized version of themselves in many situations (myself included).

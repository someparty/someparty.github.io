Bands, quite understandably, rushed to release new or rare material onto the service to take part in the event. While successful (raising $4.3 million for artists), it&#39;s made for one massive, not to mention late, weekly edition of Some Party. My apologies to whoever I&#39;ve missed.</p><hr/><p>Last week, amidst the surreal chaos and existential dread that so quickly came to dominate our lives, Toronto&#39;s <a href="http://bruce-peninsula.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bruce Peninsula</a> had the unlucky task of hyping their long-awaited return to action. The oft-haunting folk-gospel collective releases <em>No Earthly Sound</em>, their third full-length, on April 17. The 10-song LP leads with &quot;Don&#39;t Wake The Giant,&quot; the band&#39;s 2016 single from the score to the Andrew Cividino&#39;s film <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Giant_(film)" class="" target=_blank>Sleeping Giant</a></em>, along with the foot-stomping (and unexpectedly funky) new single &quot;Make a Sound.&quot; Both tracks feature <a href="http://mishabower.com/" class="" target=_blank>Misha Bower</a> on lead, and <em>holy shit</em> did I ever need this band back in my life, this week more than ever.</p><p>Bruce Peninsula, historically, consisted of Bower with Matt Cully on vocals and guitar, Neil Haverty on vocals, guitar, and metallophone, Andrew Barker on bass (and lap steel guitar), and Steve McKay on drums. I&#39;m not sure who&#39;s back this time as it&#39;s been a lifetime since 2011&#39;s <em>Open Flames</em>. Live, and in the studio, Bruce Peninsula plays with a rotating choir, an ensemble that&#39;s featured some familiar names like Tamara Lindeman (The Weather Station), Isla Craig, and Casey Mecija (Ohbijou), among others. We&#39;ll have to wait for the LPs to arrive before we can fully unpack the personnel here (it&#39;s not like you&#39;ll have an opportunity to figure it out live, under the circumstances).</p><p>The new record comes on the heels of Misah Bower&#39;s excellent 2019 solo debut, <em>Trying to Have It All</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1134085171/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=470329296/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://brucepeninsula.bandcamp.com/album/no-earthly-sound">No Earthly Sound by Bruce Peninsula</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://brucepeninsula.bandcamp.com/track/make-a-sound" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Bruce Peninsula - &quot;Make A Sound&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Speaking of comfort food, <a href="http://joelplaskett.com/" class="" target=_blank>Joel Plaskett</a> has a new video online for the single &quot;If There&#39;s Another Road.&quot; It&#39;s one minuscule portion of his massive quadruple album <em>44</em>. The track was recorded by Doug Easley, who Plaskett worked with way back in 1996 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_Hermit" class="" target=_blank>Thrush Hermit</a>&#39;s <em>Sweet Homewrecker</em>. This tune in particular features drummer George Sluppick, bassist Doug Easley, Rick Steff on piano and Wurlitzer, and organist Dave Shouse. They&#39;re among 33 musicians who worked with Plaskett on the project at several studios across North America. Plaskett and Jeff Miller directed the video, which meanders through the snow-banked streets of Dartmouth.</p><p><em>44</em> will arrive from <a href="http://pheromonerecordings.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pheromone Recordings</a> on April 17. Billed as the spiritual successor to 2018&#39;s similarly massive <em>Three</em>, the release will be split into four 11-song chapters, titled <em>41: Carried Away</em>, <em>42: Just Passing Through</em>, <em>43: If There&#39;s Another Road</em>, and <em>44: The Window Inn</em>. <em>44</em> follows up 2015&#39;s <em>The Park Avenue Sobriety Test</em>, Joel and Bill Plaskett&#39;s 2017 father-song record <em>Solidarity</em>, and the recent reunion Thrush Hermit reunion shows.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48I414tChlk" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/48I414tChlk" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Joel Plaskett - &quot;If There&#39;s Another Road&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Haligonian singer-songwriter <a href="http://mattygrace.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Matty Grace</a> recently shared <em>Rumination Year</em>, a six-song folk-punk set that the guitarist/vocalist&#39;s had in the works for years. The <a href="https://futuregirls.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Future Girls</a> frontwoman commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is an album that I&#39;ve talked about forever and I&#39;m happy to finally share it. I wrote the songs in 2016 and 2017 while my life was in shambles. So I coped and locked myself in the basement. The result is this. <em>Rumination Year</em>. A 6 song mini-LP about how it felt to have to rebuild and survive. With the current state of things these feelings seem more relevant than ever and I&#39;m happy to put this out.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Grace worked closely with Dave Williams of <a href="https://surrendersounds.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Surrender</a> and <a href="https://crusades666.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Crusades</a> on these songs. Williams served as producer, mixed and mastered the record, and provided additional instrumentation in the studio.</p><p><em>Rumination Year</em> arrives a few weeks after <em>Beneath The Bridges</em>, a four-song split cassette between Grace and the Dartmouth rock trio <a href="https://designosaur.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Designosaur</a>.

These tracks were written and recorded over four years from 2016 to the present.

The 16-track set includes pretty much what it says on the label, that is, demos, radio performances, outtakes, and other ephemera accrued over more than 20 years. The set includes collaborations with The Band&#39;s Garth Hudson, the late Gord Downie of The Tragically Hip, Mary Margaret O&#39;Hara and more. In a statement the band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;These sessions were recorded mostly on tape, mostly long ago, and mostly in a single live performance. With hundreds of songs in the vault after over twenty years, we wanted to revisit them and maybe find a home for some of the more interesting things. It&#39;s also a bit of a celebration (or memorial), with this year marking our 25th as a band. This collection may be an eclectic assortment of our material, but we are after all, a rather eclectic group.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The Sadies&#39; last proper LP was 2017&#39;s <em>Northern Passages</em>. Earlier this year, the group took part in a humourous, drug-fuelled split 7&#39; with <a href="https://kingkhanmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>King Khan</a>.</p><p>Here&#39;s a track, or at least a version of a track, that you can expect on <em>Archives</em>.

As a psych-rock group dubbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unintended" class="" target=_blank>The Unintended</a>, they recorded a single full-length in 2004, followed by a rare 2006 split LP with the <a href="https://theconstantines.wordpress.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constantines</a>. &quot;All The Way Back Home&quot; was the closing track from the former.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3525317523/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=1197985546/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://rickwhitearchive.bandcamp.com/album/the-unintended-2003-deluxe-version">The UNINTENDED (2003) Deluxe Version by Rick White Archive</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://rickwhitearchive.bandcamp.com/track/all-the-way-back-home" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: The Unintended - &quot;All The Way Back Home&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p><a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chad VanGaalen</a>, the Calgary-based artist, animator and beloved indie-folk weirdo has a second collection of b-sides online. <em>Odds &amp; Sods 2</em> follows the musicians&#39; earlier named set from December. A press release breaks down where these eight songs originated:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>Odds &amp; Sods 2</em> is a lovingly assembled compilation of unreleased B-sides, ultra-rarities and oddball tracks from the last 10 years. Some are tracks that never made the cut for an album, and ended up unreleased or on limited edition cassettes —sometimes only available on the merch table— while others represent the more synth-soaked, experimental side of VanGaalen&#39;s output.</p><p>Fans may recognize &#39;Liquid Expansion&#39;, which was regularly on the set list during touring for 2014&#39;s <em>Shrink Dust</em> — despite not making the cut. The unlikely flute jams of &#39;Origins of the Shard&#39; was also a result of the sessions from that period. &#39;Eating Ciggs&#39; and the blistering VU-jammer &#39;Reformat (Egypto)&#39; were on the shortlist for 2017&#39;s <em>Light Information</em>. &#39;Min Fun&#39; was probably recorded around the same time, and ended up on a very limited tour tape. Garage stomper &#39;Space Dreaming&#39; is maybe the oldest of the tracks, recorded around the time of the 2011 LP <em>Diaper Island</em>, and rounding out the collection are two recent instrumentals: &#39;Styrofoam Beach Toy,&#39; and &#39;The Last Starfighter&#39;s Napkin.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>All proceeds from sales of the set will benefit the <a href="https://www.sweetrelief.org/covid-19-fund.html" class="" target=_blank>Sweet Relief COVID-19 Fund</a>. VanGaalen last released the <em>Light Information</em> LP in September of 2017 on <a href="http://www.flemisheye.com/" class="" target=_blank>Flemish Eye</a> and <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3212482372/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/album/odds-sods-2">Odds &amp; Sods 2 by Chad VanGaalen</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/album/odds-sods-2" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Chad VanGaalen - <em>Odds &amp; Sods 2</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Nova Scotia&#39;s Jeremy Costello shared a similar release during last week&#39;s scramble, an &quot;outtakes and curiosities&quot; collection from his genre-less drone and psychedelia-tinged <a href="https://specialcostello.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Special Costello</a> project. The 11-song <em>Stoner Nights Vol.3 Self Isolation</em> is described as a &quot;weirdo sound bag for the dawning of the New Age&quot; and features an array of styles, with Costello&#39;s spacey vocals backed by a variety of electronics and keyboards.

Their debut 7&#39; demo holds nothing back as they frantically squeeze out 4 ripping tracks, only settling down to deliver infectious, crawl-mosh fuelling breakdown riffs. They have a sound that&#39;s reminiscent of early 80&#39;s d-beat such as TOTALITÄR, combined with the raw new school hardcore sound in the vein of bands like S.H.I.T and GAS RAG. This record is 6 minutes of pure psychosis, ranging from unhinged d-beat blasts to fist pumping mid-paced riffs, all backed with hate filled vocals that feel like a direct attack on the listener. These kids are the future.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>If you had the volume up for that lovely Jyraph track, perhaps you should notch it back down for this one.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1712393776/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://sadielasesposas.bandcamp.com/album/s-t-7-demo">S/T 7" DEMO by SADIE &amp; THE WIVES</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://sadielasesposas.bandcamp.com/album/s-t-7-demo" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Sadie &amp; The Wives - <em>Sadie &amp; The Wives</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Further west, the equally irascible Vancouver hardcore group <a href="https://punitivedamage.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Punitive Damage</a> recently shared <em>We Don&#39;t Forget</em>.

Released via <a href="http://electricheatrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Electric Heat</a>, the sneering punk act recorded these tracks in late 2018. The write-up lauds the group&#39;s approach:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Whip manage to encapsulate everything that I really dig about old punk records: A bratty, pissy-pants attitude, juvenile playing and killer songs. In the year 2020 the vision of the past is clear but it doesn&#39;t sound like they&#39;re trying to pay homage to one sound in particular nor are they adopting the tired method of carbon-copying some past heroes into some dull variation of what came before. No, Whip got something more going for them than cheap hype or revisionist punk history. Whip is here with another four songs to remind you that they&#39;re sick of your shit.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=42133664/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://whipwhipwhip.bandcamp.com/album/dont-call-me-ep">DON'T CALL ME EP by WHIP</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://whipwhipwhip.bandcamp.com/album/dont-call-me-ep" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Whip - <em>Don&#39;t Call Me</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Vancouver&#39;s <a href="http://wreckedbeach.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Wrecked Beach</a> plays psych-flavoured garage rock and recently shared their new single &quot;Fade.&quot; While they certainly harken back to the tossed-off vocal style that crested with the 2000s garage revival, the vintage surf guitar and crunchy organ licks just pull everything together in a way that feels timeless.

A city that always is in hibernation and feels so asleep during those few months in the dead of winter. Certainly far flung from what the 20 somethings experience when they &#39;move&#39; to the city for a summer. It&#39;s dedicated and closer in relation to the old men sitting in the little Italy parc on those -15 degree mornings than the grand prix weekend.</p><p>It&#39;s an interesting time now looking back, especially without the relief of spring.

Not literally, mind you. I&#39;m still as unremarkably planted in suburban Niagara Falls as I&#39;ve always been, but my relationship with the Internet and, consequently, the music news cycle is changing. It&#39;s all positive, mind you. I&#39;m regularly exercising. I&#39;m out in the vegetable garden fighting off rabbits. I&#39;m shredding the last of my countercultural cred by volunteering as a Scout leader. It&#39;s disgustingly pedestrian dad shit all around, but I&#39;m less online, which is all that matters. What&#39;s suffering is the Some Party schedule. While I&#39;m committed to this publication, I&#39;m off my weekly rhythm, which presents a few interesting hurdles, given that the world keeps turning.</p><p>I launched this newsletter in 2017 partly to push back on the twenty-year obligation I felt at Punknews to keep up with breaking news. The change of pace felt healthy on the surface, but in reality, it still reflected the rate at which most artists put new media out. I&#39;ve now lagged enough that I&#39;ll see a new single from a band arrive before I&#39;ve been able to mention the prior (my inbox is chock full of &quot;just circling back...&quot; emails - publicists love to just circle back). That&#39;s not a massive problem, but it might make for some awkward catch-up as I sort out the format. If I can&#39;t keep up with this crap, you surely can&#39;t either, so we&#39;ll defy the incessant march of time together. Since day one, every page of this website&#39;s carried the tag &quot;react to it at your leisure,&quot; lifted from Daniel Romano&#39;s single &quot;Modern Pressure.&quot; I forget it&#39;s there sometimes, but it was as true a mantra then as it is now.</p><p>Onward then, at our own inelegant pace...</p><h3 id=monk><span class=artist-title><a href="https://monkla.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Monk</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Nothing Matters&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/49wj9-kTCzI" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://monkla.bandcamp.com/album/rock" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Years ago, I had an arms-length professional relationship with Frank Bach. This is back when he was based in Sudbury, working under a different name with far less of a public profile. It was after his experimental hardcore group <a href="https://www.instagram.com/viciouscyclesudbury/" class="" target=_blank>Vicious Cycle</a> wound down, but close enough to that era that my Punknews affiliation got me in the door. We never met in person, but his firm would line up web projects on which I&#39;d do some technical heavy lifting. Likewise when I needed graphics, he was my guy. He&#39;s now living in LA, working as a key designer at the ubiquitous guided-meditation app Headspace, and from what I can glean, living a life with horizons and opportunities I can barely comprehend. I&#39;m not overly jealous, Frank&#39;s earned it, but I am acutely aware that nobody&#39;s flying me to Zurich to speak about <em>my</em> oeuvre.</p><p>Bach returns to the punk sphere this summer with <a href="https://monkla.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Monk</a>, a new recording project marrying the hardcore of his youth with the mindfulness prescribed by his current gig. The six-song <em>Rock</em> EP arrives August 4 through <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a>. It features Bach on lead vocals, backed by Daniel and Ian Romano on guitar, bass, and drums. It&#39;s always a treat to hear the latter playing at <a href="https://careersuicide.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Career Suicide</a> speeds, an opportunity that rarely presents itself with The Outfit or Ancient Shapes. Bach recorded in LA, with the ex-<a href="https://attackinblack.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Attack In Black</a> crew working from their Welland, Ontario studio Camera Varda. Headspace composer Scott Sorenson mixed and produced the vocals while also playing synth to the recordings.</p><p>You can hear the furious lead single &quot;Nothing Matters&quot; everywhere, accompanied by a video by LA director <a href="https://www.instagram.com/motionless_creations/" class="" target=_blank>Jovanni Martinez</a>. A press release roots Monk&#39;s sound in early-2000s hardcore acts 86 Mentality and Knife Fight, although neither likely had as much to say on existentialism.</p><p>Among the <em>Rock</em> EP&#39;s six tracks, you&#39;ll find <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a> taking guest credit on the song &quot;Cool &amp; Collected,&quot; while <a href="http://www.cancerbats.com/" class="" target=_blank>Cancer Bats</a> vocalist Liam Cormier guests on &quot;Monk Stomp.&quot; The set also includes a cover of the 2021 single &quot;Brutal&quot; by US pop singer Olivia Rodrigo.</p><p>Frank&#39;s back in Canada for a set of record release shows this August, with Monk playing as a four-piece supported by the Indigenous hardcore combo <a href="http://indiangiverhxc.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Indian Giver</a>. They&#39;ll retrace the group&#39;s roots with an August 11 gig at Sudbury&#39;s Townhouse Tavern, followed by Toronto show at the Monarch the next day. August 13 sees the group in Montreal at Casa Del Popolo.</p><p>Vicious Cycle last issued <em>Pale Blue Dot</em> in 2010 through Deranged Records.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/49wj9-kTCzI" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=vivat_virtute><span class=artist-title><a href="https://vivatvirtute.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Vivat Virtute</a></span><span class=media-title><em>June First</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://vivatvirtute.bandcamp.com/album/june-first" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Under the guise of <a href="https://vivatvirtute.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Vivat Virtute</a>, beloved <a href="https://theweakerthans.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Weakerthans</a> principal <a href="http://johnksamson.com/" class="" target=_blank>John K.

The album&#39;s lead single, &quot;Chorus Girl,&quot; finds the band deep in the wistful pop-punk mode of bands like The Menzingers and the Gaslight Anthem. You can see it brought to life in a video by director Victor Wiercioch. On the piece, guitarist/vocalist Travis Miles reveals:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The video for &quot;Chorus Girl&quot; explores the interconnectivity of music and memory, and how the interplay between such forces holds the power to turn grief into celebration.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Drummer/vocalist Alexander Standen continues:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Chorus Girl&#39; is a love song. I wrote it on the back bench of the van at the end of a long tour. For the first time in a long time I was super psyched to return home. My, then, new partner and I had made a tradition of going up north to her family&#39;s cottage after every tour for a week of refuge. Stocked in the place were a million CDs that we would crank up throughout our time together there. The song is about anticipation, it&#39;s about love; it&#39;s also about music and shared experience.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band recorded at Toronto&#39;s Drive Studios with Steve Rizun (The Flatlines, Brutal Youth) engineering. As always, The Penske File features the tight-knit trio of bassist/vocalist James Hall, guitarist/vocalist Travis Miles, and drummer/vocalist Alex Standen. This new record follows up on 2018&#39;s <em>Salvation</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Beqqdbwe73s" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=motherhood><span class=artist-title><a href="https://motherhoodmusic.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Motherhood</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Wandering&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/h6WW2gocJLU" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://motherhoodmusic.bandcamp.com/album/dry-heave-wandering" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Fredericton art-punk trio <a href="https://motherhoodmusic.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Motherhood</a> recently shared &quot;Wandering,&quot; completing the two-song single issued to support their summer tours.

It was a spectacle in ways that few quote-unquote punk shows are, the highlight of which happened in its final moments. In Toronto, and I have to imagine elsewhere, both groups united on stage for a collaborative encore. That included their earlier-shared Dangerous Rhythm cover &quot;Electroshock,&quot; but also a visceral take on Millions of Dead Cops&#39; landmark (and frustratingly still relevant) single &quot;John Wayne Was a Nazi.&quot;</p><p>In a statement, The Halluci Nation&#39;s Bear Witness revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;When my childhood buddy Joel Fisher first played me Millions of Dead Cops&#39; music in highschool it made a big impression on me. They had songs that cut through the loneliness of growing up in a world that I didn&#39;t feel seen in. A lot of MDC&#39;s music has stuck with me my over the decades, so when Damian Abraham and I started sharing stories about life and music, the song John Wayne Was A Nazi and my connection to it quickly became part of the conversations. It&#39;s a story I tell on Damian&#39;s Turned Out A Punk Podcast. When it came time for our 2 groups to collaborate it was the first track we landed on doing... Playing JWWAN live on stage surrounded by an amazing crew of friends was such an amazing feeling.</p><p>This cover is for 15 year old Bear and Joel listening to MDC in his parent&#39;s living room. It&#39;s also for the Friendship and Unity our bands have found together. I remember how this song made me feel in highschool and I will always remember how it felt performing it for our fans during the Here&#39;s The Unity Tour!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Fucked Up issued the ten-track <em>One Day</em> LP in January through <a href="https://www.mergerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Merge</a>, followed by the <em>Cops</em> EP in April.

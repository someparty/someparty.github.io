The rock group went far beyond the expected and unavoidable COVID break: retracting their very name from most online outlets. What&#39;s evident now is the band didn&#39;t spend the time idle - they were privately undertaking nothing less than a full-blown existential overhaul. The folk/sludge group, lead by guitarist/vocalist Adam Sturgeon, is reborn in 2021 as <a href="https://statusnonstatus.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Status/Non-Status</a> - with the new name directly grappling with Sturgeon&#39;s family history, his Indigenous identity, and how those complexities run up against the Canadian arts world.</p><p>The group detailed their new persona and perspective in a write-up at Bandcamp:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Adam is &#39;non-status&#39; as defined by the Canadian government. Adam&#39;s grandfather Ralph made the difficult decision to enfranchise in order to support himself and his family by joining the Armed Forces. Enfranchisement was the government&#39;s term for the legal process of turning in one&#39;s Status Card, terminating one&#39;s Indian Status, and becoming instead a Canadian citizen. It was a pillar of the government&#39;s assimilation policy and a requirement for any Indigenous person who wished to enlist.</p><p>In the name of providing a better life for himself and his family, Ralph was required to forsake his Anishinaabe roots, an all-too-common experience for Indigenous peoples across Turtle Island. Acts of colonial violence such as enfranchisement, the residential school system, and the Indian Act have resulted in disconnection amongst generations of Indigenous people from their communities, languages, land, and identities. Today, new voices are rising up and — through acts of reclamation via art, language, music, and community — taking back spaces that have been dominated by settler culture for so many years.</p><p>Who is native enough? Who &#39;counts&#39; as Indigenous, and who does not? These questions swirl through the Canadian arts discourse today, impacting every medium and revealing fundamental inadequacies within our current identity-defining systems. For Adam, the proof is in the work; his commitment to telling his family&#39;s story with integrity and truth informs every aspect of his music and his life. Now a father to his own young son, it is the future that allows Adam to dig further into his roots.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Matt Bobkin spoke to Sturgeon in an excellent <a href="https://exclaim.ca/music/article/status_non-status_whoop-szo_1_2_3_4_500_years_announcement_interview" class="" target=_blank>Exclaim</a> interview that dug deeper into some of the headaches Sturgeon&#39;s non-status classification creates when navigating Canada&#39;s music industry. They use the example of &quot;Cut Your Hair,&quot; a <em>Warrior Down</em> track addressing the residential school system. The band promoted a specific version of the song remixed by Ojibwe musician Daniel Monkamn (aka the Hamilton shoegaze artist <a href="http://www.zoongideewin.com/" class="" target=_blank>Zoon</a>). Despite the song&#39;s themes and the personnel involved, Sturgeon&#39;s lack of an active band membership disqualified it from consideration for Indigenous songwriting prizes.</p><p>The era of Status/Non-Status begins with a new five-song EP titled <em>1, 2, 3, 4, 500 Years</em>. The record arrives May 28 through <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed</a> and Edmonton&#39;s <a href="https://www.thegrizzlar.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Grizzlar</a> as a 12&quot; EP with an etching on the B-side. It features songs tracked in Guadalajara back in 2018 during WHOOP-Szo&#39;s tour of Mexico (material from that session appeared earlier on <em>The Dive</em>, a Grizzlar-released 7&quot; issued that same year). You can preview the new set now through the gorgeous acoustic single &quot;Find a Home,&quot; available at Bandcamp or through a new video by Olde Nightrifter and Savanah Sewell.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c5Iruw5IZU0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=talk_show_host><span class=artist-title><a href="http://www.talkshowhost.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Talk Show Host</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Crisis Actors&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/6o6pwvUd-gA" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://welovetalkshowhost.bandcamp.com/track/crisis-actors" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Not to brag, but in the pre-Internet days, I was the type of teenage nerd who ran a dial-up bulletin board system from a 386 in my parents&#39; basement. I made ANSI art in TheDraw while the rest of my peers were going to parties. So wearing my l33t <em>sysop</em> hat, I have a particular affection for the DOS vibes that kick off <a href="http://www.talkshowhost.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Talk Show Host</a>&#39;s video for their new single &quot;Crisis Actors.&quot; Your mileage may vary, but the nostalgic kick I get from this is absolutely wild. The piece is propelled along not just by the confrontational pop-punk tune but through some wonderfully clever editing as the video tears through the early Internet to emerge in the social media era.</p><p>Am I also hopelessly biased because there&#39;s a scene where you can see a Punknews.org bookmark in the browser window? Nah. You can&#39;t butter me up that easy. I&#39;m just in it for the HyperText.</p><p>In the premiere at <a href="https://www.brooklynvegan.com/watch-toronto-punks-talk-show-hosts-video-for-new-song-crisis-actors-off-debut-lp/" class="" target=_blank>Brooklyn Vegan</a>, vocalist/guitarist Chris Veinot revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Crisis Actors&#39; was written a couple of years ago and I distinctly remember worrying that the lyrics might seem dated by the time we released it, especially after we had to delay the record due to COVID. Fortunately (?) I didn&#39;t have to worry at all! Hooray? Yes, it&#39;s about stupid internet bullshit, but at its core it&#39;s about trying (and pretty much always failing) to empathize with someone who doesn&#39;t seem open to empathy.</p><p>The video was another lockdown concoction, and evolved as a kind of visual history of how my relationship with the electronic world has evolved since the early &#39;90s. But mostly it was an excuse to play ZZT again. Everyone remembers ZZT, right?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track appears on <a href="http://www.talkshowhost.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Talk Show Host</a>&#39;s 10-song debut full-length <em>Mid-Century Modern</em>, due July 4 from LA punk label <a href="https://wiretaprecords.limitedrun.com/" class="" target=_blank>Wiretap Records</a> and <a href="http://disconnectdisconnect.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>Disconnect/Disconnect</a> in the UK.</p><p>The new record finds Talk Show Host once again working with NQ Arbuckle&#39;s John Dinsmore (PUP, Great Lake Swimmers) at his Lincoln County Social Club studio. Dinsmore previously engineered the band&#39;s <em>Not Here To Make Friends</em> EP, along with their one-off 2020 single &quot;This Monologue.&quot; Talk Show Host features guitarist/vocalist Chris Veinot, drummer Sean Woolven, and bassist Fabien Rivenet.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6o6pwvUd-gA" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=heavenly_blue><span class=artist-title><a href="https://www.instagram.com/heavenlybluehfx/" class="" target=_blank>Heavenly Blue</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Demo</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://sewerciderex.bandcamp.com/album/heavenly-blue-demo" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>This week <a href="http://sewerciderecords.limitedrun.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sewercide Records</a> unveiled the first demo from throwback Halifax garage rockers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/heavenlybluehfx/" class="" target=_blank>Heavenly Blue</a>. The band&#39;s five-song demo delivers a fuzzy, punk-informed take on some Nuggets-era sounds from members of the city&#39;s interconnected lo-fi scene. <a href="https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Booji Boys</a> members Cody Googoo and Adam Ledrew recorded these tracks over the past year.

Olivier commented on the busy collage of sounds in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#39;s hard to tell what&#39;s computer music and what&#39;s actually played... Our instinct was to say, &#39;This makes absolutely no sense, but let&#39;s make it work.&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can hear one of these tracks, the erratic &quot;Hommage å M. Cusson Pour M.

The feeling of being totally lost but knowing that there is only one place you can be in that moment.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The quartet recorded these songs with <a href="https://psychicvoid.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Psychic Void</a>&#39;s Josh Kaiser.

The 12-song LP arrives June 30 as the follow-up to 2018&#39;s <em>Blackout Summer</em>. In a write-up at Bandcamp, Borcherdt, now based in Canning, Nova Scotia, explains <em>III</em>&#39;s origins in &quot;forgotten songs&quot; demoed over the years.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;For years I carried these songs around with me, intending to record them all in time. While it could&#39;ve been a heavy process, pulling them all back into my life, listening to them that morning was fun. I was hearing someone else. Forgetting them allowed me to hear them fresh and un-judged. Over the next few days I felt the sense of burden returning. My friend Alex, singer of Metz and fellow bandmate in LIDS, had the sage advice: pick a few favourites, add them to whatever is already on the go and record it all, quick! The result was a three day session at Palace, engineered by Chris Sandes. I enlisted the help of a couple friends on a few songs. It was probably the easiest studio session I&#39;ve ever done. I was back to the lessons I learned on my first Dusted record, <em>Total Dust</em>: Keep the songs bare, and unburdened. Keep the intention and emotion honest and exposed, right on the surface.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can read his full write-up at Bandcamp, which links his move eastward with the rediscovery of this material. You can preview the track &quot;Little More Time&quot; through a new video on YouTube.</p><p>With the alt-electronica group Holy Fuck, Borcherdt released <em>Deleter</em> in January of 2020 through <a href="https://lastgang.com/" class="" target=_blank>Last Gang</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcLYkQoRk-8" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=down_with_space><span class=artist-title><a href="https://downwithspace.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Down With Space</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Homebody&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://downwithspace.bandcamp.com/track/homebody" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://downwithspace.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Down With Space</a> is a Montreal-based alt-rock duo featuring Rob Helsten (vocals/guitar/synth) and Steve Dumas (drums/bass/vocals). The pair recently shared their new single, &quot;Homebody,&quot; their first of 2021. The group commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;this track emanates that fear of the unknown that we all share when we decide it&#39;s better to be an introvert. Featuring a minimalist soundscape and a driving rhythm that will keep you locked into the rich vocal arrangement, the intricacies of the chord progressions are hidden within the simplicity of the delivery. Initially the main part was composed on a Roland Juno 106 but later transcribed to guitar to better fit the feel of the song by pairing the jangle of a telecaster with the pulse of analog synth bass echoing sentiments of bands like Spoon, Low, or Arcade Fire that flirt the line between rock and electronics.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band recorded at <a href="http://www.delicateautomatic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Delicate/Automatic</a>, a Montreal studio co-owned by Helsten and Matthew Hills. &quot;Homebody&quot; follows three similarly sly and moody singles released over the past year.

Given the surreal year we&#39;re grinding through, I choose to take that notion entirely at face value and free of sarcasm. The <em>Dick Charles</em> EP features seven songs, basement-recorded to the internal mic in a laptop, with the lo-fi production values giving the material a bit of a gnarly Spits vibe (always a good thing).</p><p>The new set follows two previous quarantine releases from Cabot, a set of demos credited to <a href="https://tjcabot.bandcamp.com/album/tj-cabot-thee-artificial-rejects-demos" class="" target=_blank>TJ Cabot &amp; Thee Artificial Rejects</a>, and the new wave styled &quot;Overcompensation&quot; single.

The news came alongside a video for the new single &quot;Forget (Friendly),&quot; directed by Dominic Fontaine and Jean-François Dubé. Vocalist/guitarist Joseph Therriault commented on the song in a press release, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Forget (Friendly)&#39; is about how you deal with developing a crush on someone in the context of a monogamous partnership (especially if it&#39;s reciprocated). There are so many things we can&#39;t control. The song has no lesson - I&#39;m just as clueless about this as when I wrote the lyrics.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new record follows the band&#39;s 2018 LP <em>Dog Bless</em> and showcases their evolving slant on emo, peppered with punk, grunge, and math-rock elements. Over the quarantine period Gulfer shared a pair of archival releases: the early singles compilation <em>Anthology</em> in May and a <em>Live in Japan</em> concert recording in June.</p><p>Gulfer features guitarist/vocalists Vincent Ford and Joe Therriault, bassist David Mitchell, and drummer Julien Daoust.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P71TBk9svjY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/P71TBk9svjY" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Gulfer - &quot;Forget (Friendly)&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>A recent Bandcamp Daily article by Michael Rancic spotlights <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/prince-edward-island-punk-list" class="" target=_blank>PEI punk bands</a>, showcasing ten of the province&#39;s contemporary groups.

The single appears on the band&#39;s recent four-song EP <em>Vous êtes un personnage de roman</em>. British artist Will Morrison directed the clip.</p><p>This band recorded at Studio Pantouf in Saint-Élie-de-Caxton with engineering from Louis-Philippe Cantin (Perséide) and Pierre Brouillette Hamelin (Rorqual).

The release is the second to spring from summer 2018 recording sessions with Joshua Wells (Lightning Dust, Destroyer) at the Balloon Factory (the first, &quot;Crowd Control&quot; b/w &quot;Low Tide,&quot; arrived in May of last year). Bassist/vocalist Karmin Poirier spoke about the A-side:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We had a really good time reworking &#39;Night Creeps&#39; as we recorded it with Josh. The falling guitar with the funky chorus time signature, the synth textures, and the abrupt start all add to an uneasy feeling under the surface, while the poppy song itself rides in the forefront.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>On &quot;Wash,&quot; she revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I was kind of on a Husker Du kick when we were working on this song. I think it has a pretty frenetic vibe to it, it feels like it could go off the rails at any moment but we all just push through it. It adapts well to the energy of our live shows, not that those are a thing at the moment.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The group&#39;s planning to record their debut full-length with Jesse Gander at Rain City Recorders in September. Brutal Poodle features Karmin Poirier with guitarist/vocalist John Johnston and drummer Dustin Bromley.

The band shot the clip with director Brendan George Ko in March, right before the lockdown kicked in. It features a man dressed as a cockroach on something of a lonely search for meaning - a search amongst the kitsch and casinos of my hometown of Niagara Falls. I&#39;ll support anything that highlights the seedy magic realism of this strange town. I wish they&#39;d shown how they walked this costume through Fallsview Casino security, though.</p><p><em>Petrol Head</em> was the grunge-influenced band&#39;s follow up to 2017&#39;s <em>Clean Air</em> EP.

Songwriter Mel Sturk previously commented on the song&#39;s lyrics:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;when you&#39;re in an airplane, going between places and people you love, sometimes the things you see from 35,000 feet make you think about not just the places, but how the &#39;soft&#39; cultures of those places is reflected in the land formations below. Also, agriculture is cool.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band took those sentiments literally in the clip, pairing cell phone footage from airplane windows with clips of the members&#39; quarantine gardens. The lockdown that&#39;s restricted most of us from travelling (and curtailed the band&#39;s touring plans) adds a whole other layer of meaning to that contrasting imagery.</p><p>Based in Dartmouth, Shoulder Season features Karen Foster, Mel Sturk, Kristina Parlee, and Erica Butler.

We filmed it at Ontario Place, where it almost feels like you&#39;re walking around in ancient ruins. It turned out pretty fun and silly in a way that compliments the sort of unhinged nature of the song.

You can also hear Paul having a lot of fun in the mix.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Westelaken features Alex Baigent on vocals, bass, and synth, Rob McLay on percussion and backing vocals, Jordan Seccareccia on guitar, and Lucas Temor on piano and banjo. Paul Vroom recorded, mixed, and mastered the band&#39;s new material last fall at The Pharmacy in Toronto.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwDskHlribI" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/SwDskHlribI" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Westelaken - &#39;Mercy, &quot;milk-of-human-kindness&quot;&#39; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Last week, I shared the first new single from Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://feelsfine666.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Feels Fine</a>, and they&#39;re already back with a second cut. The group, heavily influenced by midwestern emo of the late 90s, is gearing up to release <em>Grip</em> on August 29. This week&#39;s preview is titled &quot;Imagine,&quot; and follows &quot;Washed Out Blue&quot; from the last go-around.

That&#39;s never felt so acutely surreal to me as it has this summer, with the province loosening restrictions on live events while the rest of the country remains in stasis. I&#39;m not even sure if I&#39;m envious, given that we&#39;re still in the middle of this thing, but I&#39;m certainly wistful. While <a href="https://popmontreal.com" class="" target=_blank>POP Montreal</a> just announced that they&#39;d be hosting a slate of events with an in-person audience, the real shocker for me is the news that <a href="http://www.fmeat.org/" class="" target=_blank>FME</a> is going ahead next week.</p><p>The Festival de musique émergente en Abitibi-Témiscamingue takes place yearly in Rouyn-Noranda. Over nearly two decades has forged a reputation as one of the country&#39;s most sonically diverse and artistically relevant gatherings, as well as a premier industry networking event. Remoteness certainly plays a part in that mystique, and when I was privileged enough to attend a few years back, I absolutely felt that. Unlike most live music events in 2020, FME was never formally cancelled, a fact that&#39;s become something of a source of fascination amongst my Ontario-shackled peers over the summer. This year&#39;s FME forges ahead from September 3 to 5 as a smaller-scale event, but it still brings twenty acts north to the copper mining town.</p><p>With international travel curtailed, FME&#39;s drawing almost exclusively on Quebec-based acts for its 18th year, with performances planned from a handful of artists who are no strangers to this newsletter (<a href="https://zenbamboo.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Zen Bamboo</a>, <a href="https://nobro.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>NOBRO</a>, <a href="https://corridormtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Corridor</a>, and <a href="https://fuudge.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fuudge</a> among them). The event broke down the lineup in a press-release</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Particular consideration has been given to groups whose career strategies have been gravely affected by the pandemic: Aliocha&#39;s new album; Laurence Hélie&#39;s English-language project Mirabelle; the prolific Rosie Valland; the up-and-coming act Anachnid; promising rock band Zen Bamboo; female punk project NOBRO; and the psych-rock duo Les Deuxluxes, who launched an album at the beginning of the year. We will also be treated to premieres including the prelaunch of a new project by Carla Blanc (of Dear Criminals fame); Meggie Lennon; Jonathan Personne; and Gus Englehorn. We welcome with great interest the promising hip-hop project Backxwash, shortlisted for the Polaris Prize. And we must not forget favourites from years past, including Maude Audet, Les Louanges, Corridor, Les Shirley, FUUDGE, Jesse Mac Cormack , and We Are Wolves. For his part, Gab Bouchard will roam the streets and alleys of the city with his revue Au pays des pick-up. The Bleu Jeans Bleu will also visit Abitibi-Témiscamingue for the first time to unveil their new project. Clay and Friends will offer their vibrant, traditional family show Agnico Eagle, and Neoclassical group Flore Laurentienne will showcase a rare mix of strings and synthesizers. On the hip-hop side, we welcome Lary Kidd, KNLO, Brown Family, and Eman.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can find the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/o2yn3lggjzqafvs/FME2020_grillehoraire.pdf?dl=0" class="" target=_blank>full schedule</a> online if you&#39;re curious to see how they&#39;re pulling this off.</p><p>Musical programming aside, FME&#39;s approach to operating during the pandemic bears some examination. Venues will open at limited capacities, with many artists performing their sets twice to keep crowd sizes down. Many events are outdoors, with stages on the shores of Lakes Osisko and Flavrian. Every concert requires an online reservation to maintain capacity (and presumably build a list for contract tracing), with no passport-style tickets available this year. Mandatory masking, social distancing markers, and strident disinfection efforts are all de rigueur at this point. Even in less-fraught times FME&#39;s emphasized outdoor art installations, which should work to their advantage them this September when juggling the crowds.</p><p>On July 27, Quebec increased the maximum size of public gatherings to 250 people at indoor or outdoor public events, a significant jump from the previous limit of 50 (private gatherings remain capped at 10). Festivals were prohibited until August 31.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1710755405/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://fuudge.bandcamp.com/album/sacer-facere">Sacer Facere by FUUDGE</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://fuudge.bandcamp.com/album/sacer-facere" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Fuudge - &quot;Sacer Facere&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2020-08-30-canadian-dreams/" rel=next title="Next article: Canadian Dreams"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Canadian Dreams</div> <div class=pagination-date>August 30, 2020</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2020-08-16-rock-is-my-rock/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Rock Is My Rock"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Rock Is My Rock</div> <div class=pagination-date>August 16, 2020</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

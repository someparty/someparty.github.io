That set includes &quot;The Next Fix,&quot; the nebulous unit&#39;s striking single from May of last year, along with the newly available &quot;Ouster Stew.&quot; The group wrote and recorded these tracks over a lengthy period from July of 2017 through December of 2019, self-producing the set.</p><p>While &quot;The Next Fix&quot; saw the band expand their sound with soaring world music and hip-hop influences, &quot;Ouster Stew&quot; delivers a tightly-wound counterpoint. The comparatively succinct track feels firmly rooted in the post-punk and Krautrock notes of Crack Cloud&#39;s earlier work, taking a route that&#39;s decidedly confrontational.</p><p>It&#39;s impossible to separate Crack Cloud from the elaborate visuals supporting their singles, and &quot;Ouster Stew&quot; is no exception. The video features a pastiche of armed resistance tropes, building a gleefully choreographed dance number around scenes of mock-violence and depravity that (perhaps uncomfortably, but surely purposefully) reflect the iconography of the War On Terror. The video walks a fine line, at times revelling in the dirt-strewn playground of a Hollywood post-apocalypse but also recalling images of death and depravity that became media flashpoints in the post-9/11 period.</p><p>Crack Cloud shares a few members with <a href="https://n0v3l.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>N0V3L</a>, the similarly high-concept, collectivist Victoria group who recently material on <a href="http://www.flemisheye.com/" class="" target=_blank>Flemish Eye</a>.

It arrives as an 11-song set on July 3 from <a href="https://www.solitairerecordings.com" class="" target=_blank>Solitaire Recordings</a>. The news came alongside the new single &quot;Losing,&quot; the second preview to arrive for the record after April&#39;s &quot;Thief on the Cross.&quot;</p><p>In a press release, vocalist Kenny Boothby unpacks the song&#39;s lyrical structure and reflects on its classic Canadian roots:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song tells two fictional stories about characters experiencing some kind of loss. In the first verse, the narrator&#39;s friend loses their savings on a drunken bet on a dog race. In the second, the narrator expresses regret for choosing to leave a person they still find themselves in love with.</p><p>Musically, the song is inspired by 60s and 70s Canadiana like Neil Young and The Band, and there&#39;s a certain peppiness to the piano that hasn&#39;t really been present in a Little Kid song before. It&#39;s become a fun one to play live, even without access to a piano — moving things over to guitar really brings out the Neil Young flavour of the song.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Little Kid features Boothby backed by Megan Lunn on banjo, Paul Vroom on bass, drummer Liam Cole, and guitarist Brodie Germain.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1887951541/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://littlekid.bandcamp.com/album/transfiguration-highway-2">Transfiguration Highway by Little Kid</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://littlekid.bandcamp.com" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Little Kid - &quot;Losing&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p><a href="https://shoulderseasonhfx.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Shoulder Season</a> is a four-piece garage-rock band featuring former members of Halifax groups <a href="https://thestolenminks.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Stolen Minks</a> and <a href="https://themaynards.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Maynards</a>, as well as Ottawa group <a href="https://thejohnnies.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Johnnies</a>.

The tracks, paired with two others, are now available as part of <em>Out Of My Hands</em>, the sophomore EP release from Vanity Phase. You can find them at Bandcamp now.</p><p>These songs were produced amid a period of medical uncertainty for Payne, challenged with an unexpected and sudden bout of hearing loss. The musician recounted his ailment and where it left him:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Shortly after recording my latest EP I permanently lost all hearing in my left ear. Out of nowhere the world suddenly got more and more muffled. Over the next hour I was shown the variety of sounds that tinnitus is capable of: the most memorable being complete silence, except for two distant, rhythmic bells – what turned out to be a goodbye chime from my left ear.</p><p>Later that day, Oct. 5, 2019, I was diagnosed with Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss, caused by a random viral attack on my hearing nerve. It&#39;s unrelated to sound exposure, and in a way, I was relieved to know I didn&#39;t do it to myself. In an attempt to recover hearing I tried hyperbaric oxygen therapy, laying inside a pressurized oxygen chamber 90 minutes a day for 15 days, watching DVDs inside a space travel-style tube.</p><p>Still, all I can hear in my left ear is constant static, as though I&#39;m always on a plane. Sometimes the static is mixed with random sounds: the wet squeak of cheese curds, the dry squeak of a hamster wheel, or blips and bleeps of morse code. Listening to music makes the static louder. Same with live shows, restaurants and house parties.</p><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong – I&#39;m in good spirits – but even then, things happen that we can&#39;t control, making us feel helpless. Eerily, I&#39;d already chosen this theme for my new EP, <em>Out of My Hands</em>. Made under my solo project name, Vanity Phase, these four songs and two videos were influenced by dark, melodic tones of the early &#39;80s. An ode to Depeche Mode, Fad Gadget, Suicide, No More, and the good old days when I could hear the world in stereo.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Adrian Popovich (Solids, PRIORS) produced and mixed the new EP at Mountain City Studio in Montreal, with Mikey Young mastering. The four-song set follows 2019&#39;s <a href="http://www.pleasencerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pleasence Records</a> release, <em>Unnatural Habits</em>. Before his time in the new-wave fueled Century Palm, Payne put in time in several quirky garage-punk outfits, including <a href="https://zebrassieres.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Zebrassieres</a>, the <a href="https://ketamines.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ketamines</a>, and the Fun Funs.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2353213356/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://vanityphase.bandcamp.com/album/out-of-my-hands">Out of My Hands by Vanity Phase</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://vanityphase.bandcamp.com/album/out-of-my-hands" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Vanity Phase - <em>Out of my Hands</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Amiable <a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a> offshoot <a href="https://jadehairpins.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jade Hairpins</a> recently shared &quot;Dolly Dream,&quot; the third single from the fast-approaching <em>Harmony Avenue</em>. The group commented on the accompanying video, which features some enviably uncomplicated pre-pandemic street scenes in Paris and elsewhere:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Take a trip round the world before the planes were grounded and the buses emptied and then enjoy a bit of spring sunshine on this balmy lil song. Laced with strings and keys, stacks of interlocked guitar precision, and my best Patrick Cowley/David Byrne/Daytime TV crooning.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Jade Hairpins is a synth-pop group featuring Jonah Falco and Mike Haliechuk as a quartet with the English musicians Tamsin M Leach and Jack Goldstein. The band&#39;s 10-song full-length <em>Harmony Avenue</em> arrives on <a href="https://www.mergerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Merge Records</a> on May 29.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jqed-8_91vU" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Jqed-8_91vU" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Jade Hairpins - &quot;Dolly Dream&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Last week Montreal quintet <a href="http://pottery.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Pottery</a> unveiled &quot;Hot Heather,&quot; the latest preview of their upcoming LP <em>Welcome To Bobby&#39;s Motel</em>. In a press release the group commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;While there are hints of environmental themes on this one, we mainly wanted to make a disco song with a robotic feeling, something that could be easily chanted. Austin was originally really interested in heat as a musical concept/feeling - some of the early album titles we threw around were &#39;Hot Hot Hot&#39; and &#39;Sun Fever&#39; - and there are a bunch of other heat references on the album. In the studio he&#39;d be joking around and yelling stuff at us like &#39;let&#39;s make it hot!&#39; right before a take. A lot of that didn&#39;t end up totally sinking in, but some did... like on this song.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Pushed back from its original release date, <em>Welcome To Bobby&#39;s Motel</em> now arrives on June 26 from <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain</a> and <a href="http://www.partisanrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Partisan Records</a>. Brooklyn&#39;s Jonathan Schenke (Parquet Courts, Snail Mail) produced the album, which the band recorded at Montreal&#39;s Breakglass Studio. Pottery features vocalist Austin Boylan, guitarist Jacob Shepansky, keyboardist Peter Baylis, bassist Tom Gould, and drummer Paul Jacobs.</p><p>Speaking of <a href="https://pauljacobs.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Paul Jacobs</a>, the prolific garage-psych artist recently contributed a cover of The Kinks&#39; &quot;Animal Farm&quot; to a compilation from the <a href="https://sepsisrecordclub.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sepsis Record Club</a>. His take on the <em>Village Green</em> song appears on <em>Sepsis Mixtape no. 1</em>, the first release from the young label.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2588843023/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=2513517466/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://pottery.bandcamp.com/album/welcome-to-bobbys-motel">Welcome to Bobby's Motel by Pottery</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://pottery.bandcamp.com/track/hot-heater" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Pottery - &quot;Hot Heather&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>The latest in <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a>&#39;s (seemingly weekly) series of quarantine LPs is so high-concept it&#39;s going to require a full paragraph to explain. The title doesn&#39;t do much to unpack things either. <em>Daniel Romano&#39;s Outfit do (what could have been) Infidels by Bob Dylan &amp; The Plugz</em> is a front-to-back cover of Bob Dylan&#39;s 1983 LP <em>Infidels</em> (the first secular record after the legendary folk artist&#39;s divisive evangelical period). There&#39;s a twist, though. The Outfit plays these songs, not in the style they were recorded, but in a manner they&#39;ve extrapolated from Dylan&#39;s March 1984 performance on Late Night with David Letterman. Fans widely consider that appearance, which found Dylan inexplicably backed by members of the LA punk group The Plugz, as one of the legend&#39;s most entertaining. In this set, The Outfit is therefore covering some speculative, alternative universe version of the <em>Infidels</em> record (what could have been), played in the same spirit of that Plugz-backed Letterman appearance.</p><p>Got it?</p><p>This is so esoterically nerdy that it could only have been born from the touring boredom of some long drive between shows. I suppose we can thank COVID-19 for providing enough frustrating idle time to actually see it put to tape.</p><p>If you&#39;re keeping score at home, this diversion follows last week&#39;s 23-minute prog epic &quot;Forever Love&#39;s Fool&quot; (which featured Tool drummer Danny Carey). In the weeks prior, Romano released the country-styled LP <em>Content To Point The Way</em>, the slightly less country-styled LP <em>&quot;Visions Of The Higher Dream&quot;</em>, and the not-at-all-country-styled power-pop EP <em>Super Pollen</em> (which featured the Jade Hairpins brain trust). Before going into lockdown, Danny was on the road with The Outfit supporting that band&#39;s first live album, the <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed</a> released <em>&quot;Okay Wow&quot;</em>.

With it, they unveiled a video featuring the single &quot;Swell (My Brother),&quot; a track that tackles Nunavut&#39;s suicide epidemic. As they reveal in a press release, it&#39;s one that directly impacted the creation of this record. They comment:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Swell (My Brother)&#39; is a song that breaks my heart to sing, and broke my heart to write. Over the course of creating this album, two of my childhood friends died by suicide. Losing family and friends this way is not new for the band - or anyone who has spent any substantial amount of time in Nunavut. But this song came out of the anger, sorrow, and frustration of this experience. Even as we grow up we don&#39;t seem to outgrow these feelings.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The 14-song <em>Echoes</em> is the JUNO-nominated band&#39;s fourth full-length, recorded with Jace Lasek of The Besnard Lakes producing at Breakglass Studio in Montreal. The Jerry Cans features guitarist/vocalist Andrew Morrison, vocalists/throat singer/accordionist Avery Keenainak, violinist Gina Burgess, bassist Brendan Doherty, and drummer Steve Rigby.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QbulePITfQY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/QbulePITfQY" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: The Jerry Cans - &quot;Swell (My Brother)&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>The Ottawa music community recently released the second volume in their <a href="https://ittybittylittleditty.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Itty Bitty Little Ditty</a> series.

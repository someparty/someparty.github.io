I don&#39;t know how it evaded my notice until last Friday. <em>Transfigurations</em> certainly didn&#39;t arrive out of the blue, and the group&#39;s spent the better part of the year teasing it in the usual ways. All of that passed me by. Given my self-appointed role as an adjunct voice in the Canadian music ecosystem, you&#39;d think I&#39;d be more perceptive - particularly regarding bands I&#39;ve long admired. Perhaps this is the obvious consequence of quitting most social media. Maybe I just don&#39;t have my ear to the ground as I did in my youth. I refuse to acknowledge that FemBots&#39; return is anything but a seismic event in Canadian culture, so this must be a personal failing.</p><p>FemBots were an enormously important band in my journey. 2001&#39;s <em>Small Town Murder Scene</em> arrived at precisely the right moment for me. Sitting in my dorm, retagging MP3s, I&#39;d often concoct fantasy genres to try and taxonomize my obsessions. FemBots felt contemporaneous to the Three Gut era and that first landmark Constantines record. It fit the mood of whatever tangent I was on between <em>Left and Leaving</em> and <em>Reconstruction Site</em>. They were one of several similarly amorphous folk-influenced indie rock acts I shoehorned into the Punknews coverage of the early 2000s (to everyone&#39;s annoyance). FemBots were undisputably a stepping stone on the path to whatever Some Party is today.</p><p>This new 12-song set, arriving nearly 14 years after 2008&#39;s <em>Calling Out</em>, brings back a familiar cast. The band&#39;s core remains the duo of David MacKinnon and Brian Poirier, who serve dual roles as both primary players and co-producers. They&#39;re joined here by a pair of earlier collaborators, with Guelph mainstay <a href="https://nathanlawr.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nathan Lawr</a> (<a href="https://royalcity.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal City</a>, <a href="https://minotaursband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Minotaurs</a>) returning on percussion and Greg Smith of <a href="https://theweakerthans.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Weakerthans</a> again picking up the low-end. The band recorded at MacKinnon&#39;s Junkshop studio over two weekends spanning November 2019 and February 2020, with Andy Magoffin later mastering at The House Of Miracles. The album credits fewer guests than were typical on past outings, except for <a href="https://sunparlourplayers.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Sunparlour Players</a>&#39; Andrew Penner, who delivers a monologue on the track &quot;Cry Like a Love Song.&quot;</p><p>You can now find the complete <em>Transfigurations</em> record on Bandcamp or your preferred streaming platform. Not that I reported them at the time, but FemBots issued five videos over the summer to accompany songs from the record, the latest arriving a few weeks ago to visualize &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BaFxzU2Ds0" class="" target=_blank>Don&#39;t Forget My Name</a>.&quot;</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4242809253/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://fembotsband.bandcamp.com/album/transfigurations">Transfigurations by FemBots</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=spirit_desire><span class=artist-title><a href="https://fuckspiritdesire.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Spirit Desire</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Summer Songs</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://fuckspiritdesire.bandcamp.com/album/summer-songs" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>In the works for over two and a half years, the new album from Toronto punk/emo/indie combo <a href="https://fuckspiritdesire.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Spirit Desire</a> finally sees the light of day this week. The five-piece previewed the forthcoming set in the waning days of August with a two-song EP appropriately titled <em>Summer Songs</em>. The collection features the frenetic (if absurdly named) &quot;The Sweater Song, Part 2: Even Sweatier&quot; backed with the melodic sing-along &quot;Loveliness (Bug Song).&quot; I&#39;d wager the A-side is perhaps one of the more thrillingly vibrant tracks to land in my inbox in recent memory. Don&#39;t sleep on this.</p><p>While we await details on the full-length, <em>Summer Songs</em> is available in a few physical formats. In the immediate, you can pick one up as a micro-run of hand-dubbed tapes with Risograph printed J-cards, with a similarly limited batch of lathe-cut 7&quot; records due in October through <a href="https://www.personaltouchvinyl.com/" class="" target=_blank>Personal Touch Vinyl</a>. Both formats are limited to just 30 copies and available through Bandcamp.</p><p>Spirit Desire features Sam Grace on vocals, Kai Lumbang on drums and vocals, Michelle Ferrer on guitar, Ken Wilson on bass, and Jon Iñaki on the omnichord. Everyone has a part in the group&#39;s infectious communal backing vocals (heard on &quot;Loveliness,&quot; in particular). Oh, and an omnichord, if you&#39;re unfamiliar, is a portable electronic instrument developed by Suzuki in the early 80s (sometimes branded as a Q-chord). Spirit Desire recorded their new material in a few sessions, working with Dean Snowball at Dexter&#39;s Blab before the pandemic and later convening with Em Damaschin at the Lincoln County Social Club in 2021.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4041207710/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://fuckspiritdesire.bandcamp.com/album/summer-songs">Summer Songs by Spirit Desire</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=weird_nightmare><span class=artist-title><a href="https://weirdnightmare.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Weird Nightmare</a><div class=split>&</div><a href="http://ancientshapes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ancient Shapes</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;I Think You Know&quot; / &quot;Bird With an Iron Head&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/sxRhBzjdQQU" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://weirdnightmare.bandcamp.com/album/i-think-you-know-bird-with-an-iron-head" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Fresh from the release of The Outfit&#39;s ambitious rock opera <em>La Luna</em>, <a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a>&#39;s revisiting the decidedly simpler pleasures of his power-pop side-project <a href="http://ancientshapes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ancient Shapes</a>.

That set features the latter&#39;s &quot;I Think You Know&quot; and a trio of new Shapes tunes. It arrived last week on 7&quot; through the venerable <a href="https://www.subpop.com" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a> Singles Club.</p><p>The latest incarnation of Ancient Shapes notably diverges from recent lineups of The Outfit, with Daniel, brother/drummer Ian Romano, and bassist Roddy Rosetti now joined by Justis Krar (<a href="https://sidemanhc.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>SIDEMAN</a>, early incarnations of <a href="https://singlemothersband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Single Mothers</a>) and reunited with Vee Bell (<a href="https://teeveefreakzz.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>TV Freaks</a>). Krar&#39;s a recurring character in this newsletter, but in recent years that&#39;s more often due to his found-footage video production outfit <a href="https://www.immvproductions.com/" class="" target=_blank>IMMV Productions</a>.</p><p>Edkins is well-known as the guitarist/vocalist of Toronto noise-punk titans <a href="http://www.metzztem.com/" class="" target=_blank>METZ</a>. He issued Weird Nightmare&#39;s delightfully poppy, pandemic-bred debut on Sub Pop back in May. On the collaboration with Danny&#39;s crew, he commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Daniel has been one of my favorite writers/performers for many years now and his work with Ancient Shapes and the Outfit are a constant source of joy. I&#39;m super excited to be sharing this record with him.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can see the Shapes single &quot;Bird With an Iron Head&quot; visualized now in a video animated by Romano.</p><p>Look for both bands on tour together in November, playing Ottawa&#39;s Dominion Tavern on the 14th, followed by shows on November 17 at Hamilton&#39;s Casbah, November 18 at Lee&#39;s Palace in Toronto, and November 19 at Warehouse in St. Catharines.

Alex Edkins shared:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Come On Down&#39; was originally recorded during the <em>Atlas Vending</em> sessions but never fully finished. During the pandemic I really gravitated towards the idea of collaboration as a way to fill the void left by the loss of live music. I reached out to friends from far and wide in order to get that feeling of community that gigs provide. Joe Talbot (IDLES) is a longtime friend who METZ has shared the stage with many, many times, and this song was a very natural and fun way to catch up with him and do something positive with our time off the road.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song arrived on Bandcamp paired with a download of &quot;Heaven&#39;s Gate,&quot; a 2019-era recording written for the soundtrack of the Cyberpunk 2077 video game. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_bass_tone_/" class="" target=_blank>Arturo Baston</a> directed the &quot;Come On Down&quot; video, available to check out on YouTube.</p><p><em>Atlas Vending</em>, METZ&#39; fourth proper full-length, arrived on <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain Records</a> and <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a> in the fall of 2020.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7M-fI5vNtd0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=diamondtown><span class=artist-title><a href="https://diamondtown.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Diamondtown</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Hey</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://diamondtown.bandcamp.com/album/hey" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Dartmouth&#39;s chilled-out supergroup <a href="http://diamondtown.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Diamondtown</a> recently issued <em>Hey</em>, a four-song digital EP.

Flying under the radar and mired in the pandemic, he debuted <a href="https://privatehellmtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Private Hell</a>, a decidedly calmer outlet for alt-rock and new wave sounds. That band&#39;s unfortunately no more, calling it quits with a slate of recordings dubbed <em>Eulogy.</em> Karl notes:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Private Hell is done. There are many reasons behind this decision but ultimately, the long and short of it is, this project and these songs are part of a time and place in my life that is now past. The context in which this started is diametrically opposed to how things are now, be it in my personal life or generally speaking in the world. With that in mind, investing time and energy into this and asking the same of my bandmates, when all of us have other projects and things going on, just doesn&#39;t feel right or fair. I&#39;ve poured a lot of myself into this and I am happy with what has been achieved. I would rather finish on a better note by ending it now instead of stagnate, become complacent and let it watch slowly fade into irrelevancy.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Private Hell played just a handful of shows during the pandemic, appearing as a quartet with St-Pierre backed by guitarist Antoine, bassist Dany, and drummer Marc-Oliver. St-Pierre concludes:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is going to be the last release, recorded the same way I started off in late March 2020, which is by myself in my living room.

You can see the dissonant &quot;Perfect Moment (A Beautiful Reunion)&quot; visualized in a video from Sam Maloney of the Toronto psych-rockers <a href="https://kalihorse.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Kali Horse</a>. The band shared the following statement, referencing the mystical aspects of the Italian diaspora that forms the core of their songwriting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;How do you see yourself dying? How do others see you dying? How does it feel to be left to die, when there&#39;s nothing else you can do, waiting for that &#39;perfect&#39; moment of one last euphoria: a beautiful reunion. This song is a genuflection to all of the nonni who passed during the pandemic and could not be held.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Bonnie Trash features guitarist Emmalia and drummer/vocalist Sarafina Bortolon-Vettor. The sisters recorded with Josh Korody co-producing at Candle Recording Studio in Toronto. The nine-song <em>Malocchio</em> follows up on the band&#39;s 2017 EP, <em>Ezzelini&#39;s Dead</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fXXzyDN7A8" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=single_mothers><span class=artist-title><a href="https://singlemothersband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Single Mothers</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Nausea&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/eUXSXL28q58" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Ontario&#39;s <a href="https://singlemothersband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Single Mothers</a> recently shared &quot;Nausea,&quot; the latest single from their upcoming album <em>Everything You Need</em>.

The track arrived alongside a video from director Pedja Milosavljevic featuring Hackman and Conrad Coates - a work that (in both audio and visual forms) pulls on narrative threads woven on the Toronto band&#39;s 2018 LP <em>The Love Songs of Oedipus Rex</em>. Here the artist&#39;s surrogate continues to grapple with his father&#39;s death, framed as a conversation with a therapist. Hackman comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In my dreams, as in my waking life, I, like those who have lost fathers before me, am seeking fathers inside myself, and erecting role models anywhere role models can be erected.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The work, co-produced by Hackman and Anthony William Wallace, features what the artist bills as an &quot;exceedingly large orchestra&quot; - one conducted by Maestro Robert W.

Harwood revealed in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Cement&#39; is a sort of short story about an imperfect friendship. It touches on lots of hard-to-admit emotions that can arise in relationships as people get older and life gets harder. Cement as a substance is rough. It&#39;ll scrape you if you fall on it, but at the same time, it&#39;s solid and permanent. That&#39;s what the harder side of friendships can feel like at times - bitter, jealous, unkind - but solid nonetheless in a world that changes around us and our own inner worlds changing. I can admit I was having a rough couple of months when I wrote it. It&#39;s a snapshot of a bad mood, essentially.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Lee concurred, adding:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;To paraphrase Scott, this song is about the trials and evolution of friendships, reflected against the inner battle of living in a changing city.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new album arrives October 28 through <a href="https://www.telephoneexplosion.com/" class="" target=_blank>Telephone Explosion</a> and features a massive cast of Toronto regulars, most of whom should be familiar to Some Party readers.

Kom shares:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Many years ago I did a short tour with Toby through some small, strange places in Spain and southern France. Of course, it was a treat to hear Toby Goodshank songs every night, but he also occasionally covered songs like &#39;My Uncle Used to Love Me But She Died&#39; or &#39;Tom Green County Fair,&#39; and as a fellow Roger Miller enthusiast I&#39;ve been wanting to collaborate on a project like this with Toby for ages. I guess it took the pandemic to give us both the time. We did this all rather casually and slowly, sending bits of songs back and forth to each other down the special information superhighway that links NYC and Prince Edward Island...&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmXiT1vdAdk" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=pup><span class=artist-title><a href="http://www.puptheband.com/" class="" target=_blank>PUP</a></span><span class=media-title><em>PUP Unravels Live In Front Of Everyone They Know</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://puptheband.bandcamp.com/album/pup-unravels-live-in-front-of-everyone-they-know" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto punk heroes <a href="http://www.puptheband.com/" class="" target=_blank>PUP</a> have a new live EP in the works, due October 12. <em>PUP Unravels Live In Front Of Everyone They Know</em> captures the band playing the Toronto venue History on May 14 and 15 of this year, part of their post-pandemic return to the road. You can now hear their performances of &quot;Matilda&quot; and &quot;Robot Writes a Love Song&quot; at Bandcamp. The band reflected on the shows in a short statement, commenting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Those two shows were pretty unreal. It was wild to play these songs in front of all of our families and friends and enemies and people we went to elementary school with and the guy who used to sell me weed at the Wendy&#39;s Drivethru.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The quartet issued <em>THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND</em> in April through their <a href="http://www.littledipperart.com/" class="" target=_blank>Little Dipper</a> imprint. PUP features vocalist/guitarist Stefan Babcock, guitarist Steve Sladkowski, bassist Nestor Chumak, and drummer Zack Mykula.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1004192931/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://puptheband.bandcamp.com/album/pup-unravels-live-in-front-of-everyone-they-know">PUP Unravels Live In Front Of Everyone They Know by PUP</a></iframe> </body></html> </div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2022-09-16-big-thyme/" rel=next title="Next article: Big Thyme"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Big Thyme</div> <div class=pagination-date>September 16, 2022</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2022-09-01-no-way-to-reach/" rel=prev title="Previous article: No Way to Reach"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>No Way to Reach</div> <div class=pagination-date>September 1, 2022</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

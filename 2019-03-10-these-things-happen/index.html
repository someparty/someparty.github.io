Up until now, with the exception of their solo work, I&#39;ve not had much of an opportunity. The band has a pretty clear arc through their discography, transitioning away from early caustic noise-punk to explore more dynamics with each subsequent release. The four-piece last released <em>Outer Heaven</em> in 2016, a record they chased with the curious companion piece <em>Warm Shadow</em>. If <em>Heaven</em> presented their growing maturity as a measured iteration on their established sound, <em>Shadow</em> blew their future wide-open with unencumbered glee. Freed from whatever pressure sits atop a proper LP, the companion set was free to experiment and take weird left turns. <em>Shadow</em> also laid bare Greys&#39; increasing interest in the studio as an instrument, something that surfaced prominently through <a href="https://crgillespie.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>C.R. Gillespie</a>&#39;s ambient <em>Séance Works</em> and Shehzaad Jiwani&#39;s solo <a href="https://goldendrag.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Golden Drag</a> LP <em>Pink Sky</em>.</p><p>Greys have now announced their third LP. <em>Age Hasn&#39;t Spoiled You</em> is 11 songs, due on <a href="http://carparkrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Carpark Records</a> on May 10. The first song, &quot;These Things Happen,&quot; is available to preview now. In an interview at <a href="https://www.thefader.com/2019/03/06/greys-these-things-happen-song-premiere-age-hasnt-spoiled-you-interview" class="" target=_blank>The FADER</a> Jiwani commented on the tune:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song is about perspective and understanding during chaotic times. I wanted to superimpose the socially and spiritually conscious energy of the late 60s onto our current political climate and the pervasive numbness people can feel towards opposing viewpoints when they are exhausted by their news feeds. There&#39;s so much information that you stop hearing what people might be saying. I was watching and reading lots of material about the Black Panthers, the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War protests and how that dovetailed with the rise of psychedelic drugs at the time, and how these two things could lead towards some common ground between politically polarized entities by simply trying to hear both sides out. You can feel incensed to rebel against something while also yearning for a deeper understanding of your neighbours at the same time.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song fits well into Greys&#39; arc. While it kicks off with blown-out vocals, a wall of guitar, and other familiar noise-rock trappings, it takes a satisfying swerve at the bridge about a minute in. I&#39;m fascinated to hear how off-script the band&#39;s willing to go this time out, especially given that their side-projects offer them an outlet they didn&#39;t have before.</p><p>Carpark&#39;s press release, at least, seems to indicate that the band&#39;s still shooting for something new this time out, with Jiwani commenting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We wanted to push as far away from what our perception of a &#39;rock band&#39; could be while still retaining certain characteristics that sound like Greys&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=300 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/563620692&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" class=lazyload></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/carparkrecords/greys-these-things-happen" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Greys - &quot;These Things Happen&quot; @ SoundCloud</a></p><p>This Friday will see <a href="http://www.dirtnaprecs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dirtnap Records</a> release <em>Paradise</em>, the new LP from Ottawa’s long-running power-pop/punk heroes the <a href="https://steveadamykband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steve Adamyk Band</a>. Last week I premiered track &quot;When I Was Gone&quot; over at Punknews. Steve commented on the tune:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is probably as close as we can get to traditional power-pop, or a CBC radio hit, if we were ever to have one.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Adamyk&#39;s band this time out is a trio featuring Pat Johnson of <a href="http://www.theacorn.ca/" class="" target=_blank>The Acorn</a> and <a href="https://telecomo.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Telecomo</a> drumming with Johnny O of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Uranium-Comeback-272336936168613/" class="" target=_blank>Uranium Comeback</a> on bass. The group brought in Dave Williams of <a href="https://crusades666.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Crusades</a> to record vocals in the studio (Williams was an early member of the Adamyk Band, not to mention one of Steve&#39;s old bandmates from the Sedatives). The 12-track LP was recorded with producer <a href="http://www.producedbybond.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mike Bond</a> at <a href="https://www.wolflakestudios.com/" class="" target=_blank>Wolf Lake Studios</a> in Lac-des-Loups, Québec and mixed out on the west coast by Jesse Gander (Needles//Pins, Japandroids).</p><p><em>Paradise</em> arrives in the wake of 2016&#39;s <em>Graceland</em>. Along with 11 new originals, the album also features a cover of the song &quot;Telephone,&quot; by late-70s British power-pop act The Incredible Kidda Band.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=300 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/552797868%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-VBRTx&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" class=lazyload> </iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/69318/media-check-out-steve-adamyk-bands-when-i-was-gone" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Steve Adamyk Band - &quot;When I Was Gone&quot; @ Punknews.org</a></p><p>Speaking of Crusades, last week members of the now-defunct Ottawa punk band announced their next move. Dave Williams and Skottie Lobotomy have formed a synth-pop duo dubbed <a href="https://surrendersounds.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Surrender</a>. The pair tracked an LP&#39;s worth of songs in their respective home studios over the past year, with Alex Gamble (PUP, Fucked Up, Alvvays) producing and mixing the new music at The Hive in Toronto. The single &quot;Hold On,&quot; accompanied by a video with a suitably vintage 80s feel, went live last week. A second new track is expected in the coming weeks, along with a record once those details get sorted out.</p><p>Crusades last released <em>This is a Sickness and Sickness will End</em> in 2017. They called it a career last summer.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C81pffNbg0E" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/C81pffNbg0E" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Surrender - &quot;Hold On&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p><a name=stuckouthere></a>Last week I also had the chance to premiere a new single from Toronto melodic punk quartet <a href="https://stuckouthere.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stuck Out Here</a>.

It&#39;s an apology. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The press release for the record sheds some light on Raczycki&#39;s trials over the past few years. Following the tour supporting 2014&#39;s <em>Getting Used To Feeling Like Shit</em> Raczycki experienced his first hypomanic episode, resulting in &quot;multiple hospitalizations, extended periods of psychosis, and a diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder.&quot; The band recorded with longtime producer Siegfried Meier in the summer of 2016 while Ivan was in recovery, but his illness returned that fall. These struggles inform many of his contributions to the record.</p><p>Stuck Out Here features co-frontmen and principal songwriters Cam Laurie and Ivan Raczycki on guitar and vocals, backed by bassist Emmett O’Reilly and drummer Pat Armstrong.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=300 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/481192953&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" class=lazyload> </iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/69324/torontos-stuck-out-here-return-with-embarrass-you-from-their-upcoming-third-lp" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Stuck Out Here - &quot;Embarrass You&quot; @ Punknews.org</a></p><p>This weekend I also premiered a new demo from Windsor&#39;s Matty Menard.

Last year No Fix put out three songs that authenticity struck right at the heart of late 70s punk. Those tunes will be followed soon with a brand new tape of demos titled <em>Toxic Adult</em>. You can hear one of them, the rhythmic &quot;Barriers&quot; below. It thumps along over with an eerie sci-fi vibe that fans of The Spits should lose their minds over. Here&#39;s what Matty had to say about the project:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;No Fix has been an important outlet of mine for quite sometime now, It&#39;s like some sort of therapy. Life is fucking weird and it all builds up on ya sometimes... I look forward to the ritual of making demos. I&#39;ve been involved in multiple projects at once for a long time now and as much as I love playing with friends and creating collectively, it&#39;s nice to have something that&#39;s all me, for me. More to come, Stick around.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Look for the <em>Toxic Adult Demos</em> on March 30 at <a href="https://nofixforyou.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=626920209/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://nofixforyou.bandcamp.com/track/barriers-2">Barriers by NO FIX</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://www.someparty.ca/premieres/no-fix-barriers/" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: No Fix - &quot;Barriers&quot; @ Some Party</a></p><p>Toronto industrial/electronic act <a href="http://www.odonisodonis.com/" class="" target=_blank>Odonis Odonis</a> have a new EP due in the spring.

In the premiere at Brooklyn Vegan, Thomson commented on the track, titled &quot;Break&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;On the surface, &#39;Break&#39; is about a relationship, but in broader sense, it’s about not being afraid of change and the possible consequences that can come from it. We had a lot of fun working with Alex Newport, and I think that comes through in the recording and the rest of the album.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Thomson&#39;s acerbic punk group Single Mothers last released <em>Through A Wall</em> in 2018.

While their catalogue remains small, the trio&#39;s lo-fi guitar rock marries the classic Dunedin sound of Flying Nun Records with the jangly, expansive jams of early post-punk bands like The Feelies and Television. I can drift away into &quot;Lost Boys&quot; with the same bliss I find in &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot; or &quot;Marquee Moon.&quot; As someone who spent far too long ruining their attention span in the immediate-by-design punk trenches, those rare moments of aural transcendence are hard-won and closely guarded.</p><p>While The Courtneys haven&#39;t been particularly active since the 2016 release of their sophomore album, they&#39;ve popped separately up in several recent side-projects. Courtney Gavin issued a full-length in 2020 as <a href="https://gumcountry.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Gum Country</a>, a crunchy guitar-forward duo with Connor Mayer. Bassist Sydney J. Koke shares bedroom recordings through her meditative solo electronic project <a href="https://slaylormoon.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Slaylor Moon</a>. 2022 now finds lead vocalist/drummer Jen Twynn Payne re-emerging with <a href="https://bigrig.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Big Rig</a>, delivering a rootsy spin on that breezy Courtneys sound. The band&#39;s jokingly kicking around the genre descriptor &quot;twangmo&quot; (ie: twangy emo), and while I&#39;m not convinced it&#39;s accurate, I can&#39;t believe I never saw it applied to The Weakerthans back in the day.</p><p>Payne commented on the group&#39;s origins in a press release issued through <a href="https://exclaim.ca/music/article/big_rig_jen_twynn_payne_the_courtneys_album" class="" target=_blank>Exclaim</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It all began when I rented a guitar from Long &amp; McQuade. I wanted to write songs with a banjo on them because I was obsessed with the Alex G songs with banjo on them. I was having a real phase. I started writing songs with the three chords I knew, and then we did a Porches cover that just happened to have those same three chords. From there, Big Rig was born.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The group recorded seven songs for their first album, with Payne on guitar and vocals backed by Geoffo Reith on banjo, <a href="https://woolworm.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Woolworm</a>&#39;s Giles Roy on bass, and Kyle (no last name provided) on drums (the group&#39;s since enlisted Jesse Locke of <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a> in that role). Reith recorded and mixed the group at Green Autobody, with Jordan Koop mastering at The Noise Floor. Look for an appearance on the record from <a href="http://www.moonriser.band/" class="" target=_blank>Moonriser</a>&#39;s Mackenzie Bromstad on cello.</p><p>Big Rig&#39;s self-titled set&#39;s due on June 24 through Courtney Gavin&#39;s <a href="https://peacefultapes.bigcartel.com/" class="" target=_blank>Peaceful Tapes</a> label. You can hear the album&#39;s first single, &quot;Crying in a Corn Maze,&quot; streaming now at Bandcamp.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=602201944/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://bigrig.bandcamp.com/album/big-rig">Big Rig by Big Rig</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=fake_palms><span class=artist-title><a href="https://www.instagram.com/fakepalmsband/" class="" target=_blank>Fake Palms</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Satellite&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/c7qK0b3CeKY" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://handdrawndracula.bandcamp.com/album/lemons" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Hot on the heels of <em>Dose Yourself</em>, the full-length debut from his synth-pop trio <a href="http://saunaaa.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Sauna</a>, Toronto&#39;s Michael le Riche is readying the return of his rock band <a href="https://fakepalms-pleasence.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fake Palms</a>. The group&#39;s lined up <em>Lemons</em>, their third LP, for a September 16 release through <a href="https://www.handdrawndracula.com" class="" target=_blank>Hand Drawn Dracula</a>. You can hear the album&#39;s first single, the taut, angular &quot;Satellite,&quot; streaming now and visualized in a video by director <a href="https://www.immvproductions.com/" class="" target=_blank>Justis Krar</a>.</p><p>le Riche spoke about the album&#39;s stripped-down approach in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This record is the most direct thing I&#39;ve ever done. All the distorted guitars playing 16th-note riffs in different time signatures, washes of noise and buried vocals are basically gone. In their place, we made a record that&#39;s lean and a punch to the gut. There are still some moments where the guitars get a little tricky but, in general, we tried to be as immediate as possible. The songs are all fairly short and there are almost no extra production tricks. I was inspired by records like the Dead Boys&#39; <em>Young, Loud and Snotty</em> and the Buzzcocks&#39; <em>Another Music in a Different Kitchen</em>. Maybe because of what was going on in the world at the time, or maybe just as a reaction to the last Fake Palms record - which was flush with production flourishes - it just felt necessary to kick the door down instead of knocking.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band&#39;s only constant over the years, le Riche fittingly performs the brunt of guitar, bass, and vocals on these recordings, backed by <a href="https://dillydally.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dilly Dally</a>&#39;s Benjamin Reinhartz on drums and percussion. Evan Lewis of <a href="https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ducks Ltd.</a> plays guitar on a half dozen songs, with early Palms member Patrick Marshall joining on another. Braeden Craig of <a href="https://greys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Greys</a> and Sauna drums on one track, while another pair features <a href="https://www.twistofficial.com/" class="" target=_blank>Twist</a>&#39;s Laura Hermiston on vocals. The band recorded at Candle Recording with Josh Korody (Breeze, Beliefs) co-producing and engineering.</p><p>Fake Palms last issued <em>Pure Mind</em> in 2017 through Pleasence Records.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7qK0b3CeKY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=heaven_for_real><span class=artist-title><a href="https://heavenforreal.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Heaven For Real</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Slow Clap&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/yi8FnMIPBu4" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://heavenforreal.bandcamp.com/album/energy-bar" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Following their recent EP, the Halifax-bred, Toronto-based art-rock project <a href="https://heavenforreal.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Heaven For Real</a> has a new full-length lined up on <a href="https://www.mintrecs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mint Records</a>. <em>Energy Bar</em> lands on September 16 with ten new songs, including the lead single &quot;Slow Clap.&quot; You can see that track visualized in a fascinatingly frantic (if not mildly horrific) new video from director Nathaniel Wilson.</p><p>Speaking on the album and the band&#39;s difficult-to-peg sound, Mark Grundy commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I could see us veering in a million different directions [but] we&#39;re using guitar rock as something of a palette to draw from, dig into, a lane to drive in. This is where we&#39;re at (for now)... The record is an analysis and an ode to the broader feelings of &#39;potentiality&#39; - what could be, what things will mean, where things are going; the sense of wondering, questioning, attempts at growth and self-analysis and acceptance.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Heaven For Real features twin brother songwriters Mark and J. Scott Grundy, drummer Nathan Doucet, and Cher Hann on synth. They recorded with Jonas Bonetta (Evening Hymns) at Port William Sound, with Faith Healer&#39;s René Wilson mixing. The new set follows the March-issued <em>Sweet Rose Green Winter Desk Top Tell This Side Autumn Of The Fighter Hot In A Cool Way</em> (a needlessly mammoth title, then and now) and 2016&#39;s <em>Kill Your Memory</em> LP.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yi8FnMIPBu4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=single_mothers><span class=artist-title><a href="https://singlemothersband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Single Mothers</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Baby Bird&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Hear it on <a href="https://youtu.be/wzRrHz0-lcY" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>After an endless parade of pandemic-era digital material issued under a half-dozen names, <a href="https://drewthomson.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Drew Thomson</a>&#39;s London, Ontario punk act <a href="https://singlemothersband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Single Mothers</a> looks ready to return to the physical realm with a new LP for <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a>. <em>Everything You Need</em> lands October 28, preceded by the crackling new single &quot;Baby Bird.&quot;</p><p>The new record arrives as Single Mothers&#39; first &quot;proper&quot; full-length since 2018&#39;s <em>Through a Wall</em>, although that statement doesn&#39;t capture the wealth of free-wheeling home-recordings Thomson brain dumped over the past few years (as <a href="https://drewthomson.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Drew Thomson Foundation</a>, No Idea Head, SM WorseWorld, SM Worldwide, and probably a few others). <em>Everything You Need</em> is notable in that regard as it&#39;s a work penned entirely before the 2020 health crisis.</p><p>Single Mothers latest iteration Thomson backed by Peter Landi and Daniel Ormsby.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wzRrHz0-lcY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=fiver><span class=artist-title><a href="https://fiverforreal.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Fiver</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Song Of The Mournful Millionaire&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/parPD4wjvyk" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://fiverforreal.bandcamp.com/album/soundtrack-to-a-more-radiant-sphere-the-joe-wallace-mixtape" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Erudite alt-country artist Simone Schmidt, better known as <a href="http://www.fiverfiverfiver.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fiver</a>, recently shared the first track from a new recording dubbed <em>Soundtrack to A More Radiant Sphere: The Joe Wallace Mixtape</em>. &quot;Song Of The Mournful Millionaire&quot; features lyrics written in 1950 by Canadian poet Joe Wallace. Schmidt notably dedicates the recording &quot;to all the space exploring pervert billionaires out there.&quot;</p><p>Filmmaker Sara Wylie commissioned the song for her documentary <em>A More Radiant Sphere</em>, which premiered at Vancouver&#39;s DOXA Documentary Film Festival this past May. The film explores the forgotten story of Joe Wallace, a communist activist, journalist, poet, and political prisoner. Schmidt explains:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Wallace was largely ignored by the broader Canadian literary scene (but revered in Eastern Europe and Russia) because he was a commie &amp; also because his peers said he lacked nuance and style. Milton Acorn said it was &#39;usually bad, but sometimes totally inspired.&#39; I agree. However when Sara asked me to pick 5 poems to make into song, I did find some prescient ones. Unsurprisingly, he had a knack for describing &amp; predicting the outcomes of capitalism. Wallace wrote &#39;Song of The Mournful Millionaire&#39; in 1950, the year Richard Branson was born. It was also 11 years before Yuri Gagarin went to space. When I read the poem for the first time in 2020, I was struck at how apt a roast of today&#39;s oligarch space colonists it is.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Fiver&#39;s score features Nick Dourado (<a href="https://budi.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Budi</a>) on lap steel and piano, John Showman on fiddle, and <a href="https://heavenforreal.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Heaven For Real</a>&#39;s Nathan Doucet on percussion. A cassette release, the collection features vocals on the A-side and instrumental versions on the flip. You can now hear the track &quot;Drink Less Champagne&quot; on Bandcamp as a sample of the latter. The mixtape arrives July 8 through <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>.</p><p>Last year Fiver issued the improvisational <em>Fiver with the Atlantic School Of Spontaneous Composition</em>, featuring many of the same personnel. Sonically the <em>Joe Wallace Mixtape</em> material falls a little closer to the haunting folk of 2017&#39;s <em>Audible Songs From Rockwood</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2163947488/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://fiverforreal.bandcamp.com/album/soundtrack-to-a-more-radiant-sphere-the-joe-wallace-mixtape">Soundtrack to A More Radiant Sphere : The Joe Wallace Mixtape by Fiver</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=bonnie_trash><span class=artist-title><a href="https://bonnietrash.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bonnie Trash</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Teeth&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/72sSupDhEb4" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://handdrawndracula.bandcamp.com/track/teeth" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Guelph, Ontario drone-rock duo <a href="https://bonnietrash.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bonnie Trash</a> have signed with <a href="https://www.handdrawndracula.com" class="" target=_blank>Hand Drawn Dracula</a>, sharing the muscular single &quot;Teeth&quot; as the first preview of their forthcoming debut LP. The song arrives alongside a video directed by the band, a piece that reflects their Italian ancestry and family lore. They comment:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We created a short film to help narrate stories our Nonna Maria told us about being haunted and followed by a curse in her hometown of San Zenone degli Ezzelini in Treviso, Italy. That short eventually became the concept of our album, which is woven into our first music video, &#39;Teeth.&#39; Shot at the Apollo Cinema in Kitchener, Ontario, &#39;Teeth&#39; bridges generations of being haunted - we see ourselves watching our work without understanding that we too have conjured the curse. A malocchio follows.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Bonnie Trash is a project of twin sisters Emmalia and Sarafina Bortolon-Vettor. Emmalia plays guitar on the track, with Sarafina on drums and vocals. The group recorded with Josh Korody co-producing at Candle Recording Studio in Toronto. The new set follows the band&#39;s 2017 <em>Ezzelini&#39;s Dead</em> EP and a few subsequent digital singles issued in 2019. Look for the group performing as a four-piece at the final <a href="https://kazookazoo.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Kazoo Fest</a> in Guelph this summer.

I&#39;ve also been trying to move away from writing about self-deprecation and self-criticism, and instead trying to look outward and write about the people around me. I&#39;m very clearly writing about my partner here, chronicling our relationship and expressing my awe for her. Being forced to stay indoors for the past couple years has given me time to appreciate how fortunate it is to have someone in your life you love, admire, and are happy to be around all the time.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can hear the song at Bandcamp or see it visualized in a psychedelic clip on YouTube, directed by Bryanna Chapeskie.

It&#39;s always a challenge covering live events here (this mailing would be nothing but lineup announcements and tour dates otherwise), but Sappy feels special for reasons that, while elusive, transcend geography.</p><p>The event takes place from July 29 through the 31st in the New Brunswick college town. This year&#39;s partial lineup features <a href="https://amidang.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ami Dang</a>, <a href="https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Apollo Ghosts</a>, <a href="https://bird-feet.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bird Feet</a>, <a href="https://cedricnoelmusic.bandcamp.com/music" class="" target=_blank>Cedric Noel</a>, <a href="https://circuitdesyeux.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Circuit des Yeux</a>, <a href="https://jonmckiel.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jon Mckiel</a>, <a href="https://kellymcmichael.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Kelly McMichael</a>, <a href="https://klarkaweinwurm.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Klarka Weinwurm</a>, <a href="https://ombiigizi.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>OMBIIGIZI</a>, <a href="https://sook-yinlee.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sook-Yin Lee</a> (both solo and as part of Lee &amp; Gamble Unlimited), <a href="https://wearyy.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Weary</a>, and <a href="https://wolfcastle.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Wolf Castle</a>. At the event, Lee and Gamble plan to screen their films <em>Death and Sickness</em> and <em>Who Cares?</em> with a subsequent Q&amp;A. <a href="https://www.amerysandford.com/" class="" target=_blank>Amery Sandford</a>, who we first met as the guitarist/vocalist of <a href="https://bbqtband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>BBQT</a>, is the festival&#39;s resident visual artist this year.</p><p>Andrea Vincent, Sappyfest&#39;s new creative director who formerly helmed the Dawson City Music Festival, had this to say in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We are grateful to be making plans to reconvene in person this year, to fill our cups with music and friends, and in deep reverence of the gifts that live music and art bring. In some ways making plans has felt big, scary, and a little hesitant. But as our dear friend and former director Steve Lambke once wrote, &#39;to make a plan is to claim a hope for the future.&#39; It&#39;s that hope and a vision of coming together under summer skies that propels us forward.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>I need not reiterate the collective trauma of the pandemic age. It&#39;s certainly not exclusive to me, nor are we free of it, but the ability to gather again - cautiously, hopefully, fretfully - feels momentous. I can&#39;t uncouple the event from my pent-up wanderlust or my (perhaps) naive yearning for normal times. We&#39;ll all have our hard-fought moments of social reclamation over the next few years, and a return to Sappy is mine. I hope you&#39;ll indulge me when it becomes prominent in my writing these next few weeks.</p><p class=image><img src="/images/articles/sappyfest17.jpg" alt="Sappyfest 17"/></p> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2022-06-21-eating-the-screen/" rel=next title="Next article: Eating the Screen"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Eating the Screen</div> <div class=pagination-date>June 21, 2022</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2022-06-02-performative-hours/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Performative Hours"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Performative Hours</div> <div class=pagination-date>June 2, 2022</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

How about a cassette compilation series inspired by that same newsletter?</p><p>Ignoring all sound advice to the contrary, I&#39;m thrilled to plumb new depths of misguided effort with Some Party&#39;s <em>Under The Circumstances</em> series!</p><p><em>Under The Circumstances</em> will be a periodic ongoing series of limited-run tape compilations showcasing new, rare, and weird tracks from some of the coolest Canadian artists from across the spectrum of punk, psych, garage, and indie rock. Volume 1 is available to order now and is shipping immediately. I&#39;m thrilled that some of my all-time favourite artists have contributed material for this inaugural set.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <div class=store-button> <a href="https://someparty.bandcamp.com/" target=_blank>Buy Now</a> </div> </body></html> </div><h2 class=generic>Side A</span></h2><p><span>1.</span> <strong>New Vogue</strong> - &quot;Deny Me&quot;</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://newvogue.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>New Vogue</a> is the wild new DEVO-core project from Max Desharnais of Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://sonicavenues.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sonic Avenues</a> and <a href="https://priorsmtl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>PRIORS</a>. It&#39;s a robotic assault of spazzed-out new wave and cyborg post-punk. A future mutation of &quot;Deny Me&quot; is expected on the upcoming New Vogue full length, but you&#39;ll only hear this first incarnation on <em>Under The Circumstances</em>.</p></blockquote><p><span>2.</span> <strong>Tough Age</strong> - &quot;The 15th&quot;</p><blockquote><p>A few years back <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a> pulled up stakes in Vancouver and relocated to Toronto, with guitarist Jarrett Samson and bassist Penny Clark reinventing their <a href="https://www.mintrecs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mint Records</a> garage-punk outfit as a trio with Calgary&#39;s Jesse Locke on drums. <em>Shame</em>, their first album of this new era, found the band delving headfirst into the Dunedin sound, geeking out over The Clean and that classic 80s Flying Nun roster. The <em>Shame</em> sessions also found the band warming with a few classic covers, notably &quot;The 15th,&quot; originally from Wire&#39;s 1979 record <em>154</em>. You&#39;re hearing it here for the first time ever.</p></blockquote><p><span>3.</span> <strong>Psychic Void</strong> - &quot;Boneshaker&quot;</p><blockquote><p>It&#39;s been a few years since their <em>Terminal Vacation</em> tape kicked my ass, and I&#39;m still singing the praises of Windsor&#39;s <a href="https://psychicvoid.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Psychic Void</a>. The group marries the influence of 80s hardcore with tough-as-nails rustbelt protopunk. That&#39;s all given a spaced-out psych-rock flair thanks to Jesse Knight&#39;s reverb-drenched growl. &quot;Boneshaker&quot; is the band at their most aggressive, and one of the standout tracks from their brand new <a href="https://vanillabox.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Vanilla Box</a> LP <em>Skeleton Paradise</em>.</p></blockquote><p><span>4.</span> <strong>Partner</strong> - &quot;Lost My Pick, Can I Borrow One?&quot;</p><blockquote><p>Landing in Windsor from their Sappy start in Sackville, New Brunswick, the righteously queer slacker rock act <a href="https://www.partnerband.com" class="" target=_blank>Partner</a> are still riding high from their triumphant <a href="https://polarismusicprize.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Polaris</a> shortlisted <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed</a> LP, <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>. &quot;Lost My Pick, Can I Borrow One?&quot; is a confection, a quip as an excuse for a bit of effortless guitar heroism from Lucy Niles and Josée Caron. It appears here on a physical release for the first time ever.</p></blockquote><p><span>5.</span> <strong>Wares</strong> - &quot;City Kids (Alt)&quot;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;City Kids&quot; has been the rallying cry for Cassia Hardy&#39;s musical outlet <a href="https://wares.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Wares</a> for years now, but you&#39;ve never heard it like this. For this tape, the fuzzy Edmonton indie rockers turn the song indie out, crafting a gorgeous, undersea shoegaze take on their flagship tune. The band&#39;s follow-up to their self-titled 2017 LP is destined to arrive in early 2020, but you most certainly want to hear this wild reinvention of their past before then.</p></blockquote><h2 class=generic>Side B</span></h2><p>Some Party can neither confirm or deny the existence of a B side to this tape. It certainly wouldn&#39;t feature a sampler of other cool material from these same artists, along with a few twists and turns along the way. The very notion is preposterous.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <div class=store-button> <a href="https://someparty.bandcamp.com/" target=_blank>Want one?</a> </div> </body></html> </div><h2 class=generic>So What&#39;s With The Title?</span></h2><p>In 1972 the CBC&#39;s Peter Gzowski challenged listeners to complete the saying &quot;as Canadian as...&quot; (our counterpart to &quot;as American as apple pie&quot;). The winning submission, from Heather Scott, read &quot;as Canadian as possible, under the circumstances.&quot;</p><p>Some Party&#39;s mission is similarly pragmatic. I focus on this county not to celebrate it, but to explore the bonds forged between disparate local music scenes linked by little else than an inconvenient southern border. Canada isn&#39;t all that special, but rock&#39;n&#39;roll most certainly is. If there&#39;s one thing the Ramones taught us, it&#39;s that anyone can make this racket. The bands, and the scenes supporting them, can crop up just about anywhere. In that sense, Canada&#39;s just a vessel.</p><p>These are the lines we draw and the connections we make under the circumstances of where we just happen to be.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <div class=store-button> <a href="https://someparty.bandcamp.com/" target=_blank>Buy Now</a> </div> </body></html> </div><h2 class=generic>Burning Questions</span></h2><p><strong>Are you going to release these songs digitally?</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not. My interest is in adding some physical artifact to the ongoing cultural conversation, some waymarker that&#39;s a little more real than these zeros and ones. That&#39;s the tape, and these aren&#39;t my songs. The bands, of course, may or may not release as they see fit, and a few are already online.</p><p><strong>Can I get a copy directly from the bands?</strong></p><p>Quite likely, and while supplies last. Each band had a batch to do with what they will.</p><p><strong>Are you going to make more if you run out?</strong></p><p>I&#39;m not inclined to, and at least not in an identical format. A second version, if it ever comes about, would need to be distinct in some way.</p><p><strong>How many of these exist?</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve got 100. The bands have a few more on top of that. These could move quickly, or they could sit in the Some Party closet for the next decade, but why take the chance?</p><p><strong>Is it safe to order these online?</strong></p><p>The online store is hosted by Bandcamp and they handle the credit card or PayPal transactions. Some Party never touches the card numbers, so everything&#39;s entirely PCI compliant (if that means anything to you).</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <div class=store-button> <a href="https://someparty.bandcamp.com/" target=_blank>So... anyone want a tape?</a> </div> </body></html> </div> </article> </div> <footer> <div class=footer-icon> <a href="https://github.com/someparty/someparty"> <img src="/images/github.svg" alt="Fork Me On GitHub" width=50px /> </a> <p>Source code for Some Party is available under an MIT License at <a href="https://github.com/someparty/someparty">GitHub</a>.</p> </div> <div class=footer-icon> <a rel=license href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" style="text-decoration:none;"> <img src="/images/cc.svg" alt="Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license" width=50px /> <img src="/images/by.svg" alt="Attribution Required" width=50px /> </a> <p>Content on this site is licensed under a <a rel=license href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.</p> </div> </footer> </body> </html>

Never one to comment overtly on his work, Romano shared a fittingly absurdist poem in a press release, stating:</p><blockquote><p>What is a secret, what is a dream?<br/> What is the truth and the in-between?<br/> Outfit is cryptic, Outfit is shifty,<br/> Outfit is shrouded in mystery.<br/> Bring us wisdom, private seeds<br/> bring us paintings, bring us sight,<br/> bring us fruits and jewelry<br/> Bring us the children of the night.</p></blockquote><p>Due September 10, <em>Cobra Poems</em> features ten new songs recorded in December 2020 at the band&#39;s recently constructed Rose City studio, Camera Varda. <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> is carrying the release.</p><p><em>Cobra Poems</em> follows The Outfit&#39;s recent live record <em>Fully Plugged In</em>, an 11-song set captured in Atlanta in those last innocent days before the pandemic brought touring to a halt. Both albums feature Romano backed by the group&#39;s now-solidified lineup of vocalist Julianna Riolino, bassist Roddy Rosetti, guitarist Dave Nardi, and Danny&#39;s brother (and fellow <a href="https://attackinblack.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Attack In Black</a> alumni) drummer Ian Romano.</p><p>These latest records arrive following Danny&#39;s milestone run of 11 distinct albums released (mostly digitally) during the various 2020 lockdowns, with a 12th (<em>Kissing The Foe</em>) surfacing earlier this year.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/51Jvhv0Fwso" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=the_obgms><span class=artist-title><a href="https://theobgms.com/" class="" target=_blank>The OBGMs</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;To Death&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/DhCLlDrT2Co" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Fresh off the announcement that <em>The Ends</em> made the Polaris Music Prize <a href="https://polarismusicprize.ca/short-list/" class="" target=_blank>short list</a>, Toronto punk trio <a href="https://theobgms.com/" class="" target=_blank>The OBGMs</a> issued a video for the record&#39;s final single.

We&#39;ve been on a path fighting for recognition in this game for our community. We couldn&#39;t do this without you. If you want to help us, watch our videos, stream our music.

The OBGMs play as a trio on the 10-song record, with McFarlane backed by bassist Joseph Brosnan and drummer Colanthony Humphrey.

At their core, Nailheads operates as a three-piece of lead vocalist/bassist Ritchy Nails, guitarist Raffy Mars, and drummer Lucky. They&#39;re joined in the studio on this outing by guitarist The Black Cat, percussionist Jason Paige, and nearly a dozen others (adding horns, keys, and other accompaniments). Nails writes from the punk storyteller playbook, a street romantic in the tradition of Joe Strummer and Mike Ness. The band likewise incorporates a swath of traditional rock&#39;n&#39;roll, folk, and R&amp;B influences across these nine songs.</p><p><em>Live To See Tomorrow</em> finds Nails co-producing with engineer Peter Edwards. The band recorded at Indica Records&#39; Studio Plateau in 2019.

It&#39;s about the things that get in our way of getting or being who or what we want—whatever that may be. The chorus is about putting aside the things that might be in your way and getting past your own ego.

Though I do mention a &#39;baseball bat&#39;. Sports and religion are two vital powers surrounding rural Nova Scotian childhood that I got to be totally ignorant of. I can thank supportive parents for that. The song I wrote is more about shitty parents. My wife and I were living apart. She was taking a cinematography course while I was living in rural New York. She needed music for an assignment so I wrote and recorded three songs for her that weekend. Two of the three were secretly for her, not just for her assignment. One was probably the most &#39;love-song-iest&#39; love song I ever wrote- cuz that&#39;s what we do when we miss someone. And the other was a song about growing up amidst narcissists. Though I never explicitly told her that, I&#39;m sure she understood the meaning. It&#39;s a song of sympathy, more accurately empathy. And therefore it is still a love song. It&#39;s also a song about being really blue cuz that&#39;s how I felt when I wrote it.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Baseball&quot; features Borcherdt&#39;s vocals supported by Robbie Grunwald on Wurlitzer, Brett Higgins on upright bass, Shaun Brodie on trumpet, and drums from Brad Kilpatrick. Jarvis Taveniere (Woods/Purple Mountains) mixed and played organ on the track.</p><p>The 12-song <em>III</em> arrives June 30 as the follow-up to Dusted&#39;s 2018 set, <em>Blackout Summer</em>.

Following a year stuck in isolation that found frontman Daniel G. Wilson exploring a wide range of genres, the group&#39;s settled into a style that&#39;s truly their own (one they&#39;ve even given a name). Wilson commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;[<em>Richmond Station</em> is] the culmination of two years of writing and a recording. a fusion of Jamaican culture and mysticism with post hardcore that I call &#39;Burru Punk&#39;, it is a loose concept record showing a journey from pain to salvation (or inner peace if you prefer). Each song is inspired by some aspects of my personal history/family history, and Jamaican/caribbean/Latin American history.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The 8-song record features Daniel G. Wilson on guitar and vocals, drummer Matthew Mikuljan, and bassist Kieran Christie. Wilson recorded the band at his home studio, The Lions Den, with Austin Nops of <a href="https://store.theeffens.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Effens</a> mixing and mastering at Lootbag Studios. Several guests appear on the record, including <a href="https://weatherboy.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Weatherboy</a>&#39;s Isaiah Canario, <a href="https://burnerband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Burner</a>&#39;s Deshaun Molloy, and perhaps most strikingly, Daniel&#39;s mother Winnifred Wilson.

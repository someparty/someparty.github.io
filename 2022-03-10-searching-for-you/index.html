So my apologies if this feels like decidedly old news - it is at today&#39;s pace. <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a>&#39;s relentless promotional machine won&#39;t let me forget it either, bombarding me with daily reminders of how behind I am. My struggles with target marketing notwithstanding, the label&#39;s zeal seems justified. The lead single &quot;Searching for You&quot; delivers such a joyous sugar high that a bit of over-exuberance feels entirely forgivable.</p><p>Edkins is, of course, known as the guitarist/vocalist of noise-punk standard-bearers <a href="http://www.metzztem.com/" class="" target=_blank>METZ</a>, and while the Toronto trio certainly hasn&#39;t run out of gas - the pandemic did force them off off the road. The group issued <em>Atlas Vending</em> in the fall of 2020, with supporting tours only now disentangling from the COVID bramble. The downtime provided Edkins with the opportunity to finish a slate of songs that didn&#39;t fit the band&#39;s sludgy extremes - some of which sat on the shelf as demos from as far back as 2013. While the brisk punk of &quot;Searching for You&quot; certainly shares METZ&#39; penchant for lo-fi distortion, it could never be mistaken as one of that band&#39;s songs. Edkins commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#39;s a fun, no nonsense rock &#39;n&#39; roll song. It&#39;s about searching for meaning and inspiration all around us. In my mind, the &quot;you&quot; in the chorus refers to something bigger than companionship or love; it&#39;s that intangible thing we all look for but never find...&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Due on May 20, the upcoming record promises ten new songs that show off this decidedly different shade of Edkins&#39; songwriting. It&#39;s certainly not pop - but it feels worlds less encumbered than METZ&#39; oft-punishing outlook. He continues:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Hooks and melody have always been a big part of my writing, but they really became the main focus this time. It was about doing what felt natural... My favorite songs are the simple ones. I&#39;ve never been attracted to virtuosity or technicality. Certain songs have the power to lift your spirits like nothing else can. I wanted to create that type of song.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The upcoming record features several notable guests, with Calgary folk mutant <a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chad VanGaalen</a> appearing on &quot;Oh No&quot; and Alicia Bognanno of Nashville&#39;s <a href="http://www.bullythemusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bully</a> singing on &quot;Wrecked.&quot;</p><p>A record release show, supported by Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://shamfamily.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sham Family</a>, is scheduled for May 21 at The Baby G, followed by a tour with <a href="https://kiwijr.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Kiwi Jr.</a> that crisscrosses the border.

Two previews from the album are now online - the slick English language &quot;Parfois&quot; and the newly unveiled French track &quot;Évidemment.&quot; While the former&#39;s a more conventionally structured new wave throwback, the latter&#39;s quirky instrumental refrain and reverb-drenched vocals feel wonderfully distinctive.

We now have our first taste of that with three new songs, &quot;Sweet Rose,&quot; &quot;Green Winter,&quot; and &quot;Desk Top.&quot; You can hear them all at Bandcamp, with a full six-song EP due March 25. That record carries the mammoth title of <em>Sweet Rose Green Winter Desk Top Tell This Side Autumn Of The Fighter Hot In A Cool Way</em> - a concatenation of every song title that no human shall ever hope to mutter aloud without practice.

The group issued <em>Danny, It&#39;s Not Your Birthday</em> last Friday, revealing that the set resulted from an attempt at fraud. An individual contacted the band online seeking to commission a birthday song, all as the means of kicking off a banking scam. While the band avoided the worst of the financial trap, they still wrote the song! Frontman Ben Disaster commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;...this scam targets mostly singer songwriters and now bands. Someone asks for a song and gives a big heartfelt story. They over deposit money and when you send the remainder their cheque bounces. Then you are left with the debt of what you sent them plus the bank fees. It&#39;s crazy to me. And around Christmas too.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can find the full story at Bandcamp, along with the resulting audio.</p><p>Real Sickies issued <em>Love is for Lovers</em> last year through <a href="https://stomprecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stomp Records</a>.

What kind of disco space odyssey will you go on?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new songs follow the double A-side singles &quot;Only Luck&quot; and &quot;Modernization&quot; in previewing the new album, due May 20 through the band&#39;s namesake Sauna Records.

The set lands via <a href="https://wearebusybodies.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>We Are Busy Bodies</a> as a one-sided limited edition 12&quot; record. In a statement, singer/songwriter Mikhail Galkin commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>Stars We Lost</em> comes from the classic tabloid headlines of when celebrities pass. I thought it sounded like a good album title and thematically reflected some of the record... Our first records were more traditional Psych/Stoner Rock albums, propelled by guitar riffs and solos, but we ultimately always wanted to reach beyond that. We love Sleep and Sabbath and King Gizzard but we also love De La Soul and Madlib, for example. The approach for this record was much closer to 3 feet High and Rising (De La), where we look at all the ideas and sounds we have in our minds almost as samples. Once you approach the recording process in that way, where you&#39;re almost building a sound collage around a song you wrote with just a guitar, the world opens up musically. The end result is still under the psych umbrella, but we hope it translates to something that transcends cliche and categorization.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Lammping emerged as a songwriting project between Galkin and <a href="https://badgeepoque.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Badge Époque Ensemble</a> drummer Jay Anderson.

I don&#39;t have a clue how to play it and all the guitar tracks are in different capo positions. I&#39;ll probably never know. When I got to the mountains in New Mexico, this was an instrumental that I always had planned to write lyrics to, but I hadn&#39;t had the chance yet. Again, I wrote the words and recorded the vocals in the middle of the night, very high, and put it on my hard drive and never listened to it again. I knew it would be on the album because I knew I&#39;d never write a ballad-esque, emotionally-driven high-desert-by-way-of-Brooklyn shuffle ever again. When we got to the studio in LA to record the live drums that&#39;s all we did to it. I left all the demo tracks and all my home recorded vocals on it because I couldn&#39;t recreate the mood–and like I said... I have no idea how to play this song. It&#39;s about the feeling of wanting to throw yourself into someone else and completely disappear, that feeling of wanting to spend every waking moment together. I deeply fear that in this new world of intense isolation I might never feel that again.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>GUV III</em> arrives tomorrow (March 11) through <a href="http://www.runforcoverrecords.com" class="" target=_blank>Run For Cover</a> and <a href="https://www.handdrawndracula.com" class="" target=_blank>Hand Drawn Dracula</a>, to be followed by <em>GUV IV</em> later in the year.

In case you&#39;ve been living under a rock, the popular Toronto punk quartet issued &quot;Matilda&quot; as the latest preview of <em>THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND</em>. Lead vocalist Stefan Babcock revealed the story behind the track in the band&#39;s newsletter:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Matilda was a gift from my friend Ryan. We were on tour in 2014 with our pals The Menzingers, it was the first time we&#39;d ever played in Richmond Virginia and everybody hated us and we played like shit and it was BAD but now our shows in Richmond are GOOD it&#39;s funny how sometimes things get BETTER OVER TIME unless they get WORSE, which they FREQUENTLY DO. Wow, sorry. Dark.</p><p>Anyway, like I was saying, the show was piss. And at the end, I accidentally dropped my only guitar and it broke into pieces. We were in the middle of a long tour and I had no guitar and no money to buy a replacement, and Ryan literally gave me his guitar. It&#39;s up there on my list of &#39;nicest things anyone&#39;s ever done for me&#39;.</p><p>I played Matilda nonstop for 5 years at every single PUP show, even when my bandmates started complaining that she sounded like shit. As the shows got bigger, the pressure to sound better was building and so eventually they convinced me to buy a &#39;good&#39; guitar and I played Matilda less and less. Before I knew it I hadn&#39;t played her in over a year. I wrote this song based on this intense feeling of guilt and sadness and shame and nostalgia and regret, watching her rot away in a corner. I love this guitar and I love Ryan and wanted to do right by them, and I felt like I&#39;d failed them both. I convinced the band that Matilda deserved one last rip on a PUP record, and I played her during the bridge of this song. It sounds so shitty. But good shitty. Great shitty. For me, it was the most joyful and cathartic moment in the entire making of this record.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song arrived alongside a video directed by Jeff Dutton, starring comedian Mike Mitchell (of the Doughboys podcast).</p><p><em>THE UNRAVELING OF PUPTHEBAND</em> arrives on April 1 through the band&#39;s <a href="http://www.littledipperart.com/" class="" target=_blank>Little Dipper</a> imprint. The new record follows the Toronto band&#39;s pandemic-era EP <em>This Place Sucks Ass</em> and their critically lauded 2019 album <em>Morbid Stuff</em>. PUP features vocalist/guitarist Stefan Babcock, guitarist Steve Sladkowski, bassist Nestor Chumak, and drummer Zack Mykula.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-zXiLs9zKMs" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=stick_farm><span class=artist-title><a href="https://supremeecho.bandcamp.com/album/stick-farm" class="" target=_blank>Stick Farm</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Reharvest</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://supremeecho.bandcamp.com/album/stick-farm" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://supremeecho.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Supreme Echo</a> has several reissues of long-lost Canadian punk records on deck for this year, and last week the Victoria-based archival label announced a pair of them.</p><p><a href="https://supremeecho.bandcamp.com/album/stick-farm" class="" target=_blank>Stick Farm</a> also hailed from Victoria and in their early 90s run played thrashy hardcore informed by bands like Neurosis and Nomeansno.

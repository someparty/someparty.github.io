Due February 19, 2021, the 11-song <em>Real One</em> finds the denim-clad rockers working with producer Kevin Ratterman (White Reaper, Strand of Oaks, Murder By Death). In a press release, Coffey spoke about &quot;Back With The Gang,&quot; the triumphant first preview of the project:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Back With The Gang&#39; is our way of saying &#39;WE&#39;RE BACK! AND WE&#39;VE STILL GOT GUITARS.&#39; We got really into junkshop glam while recording this, particularly bands like Laurice, The Equals, Slade, and Sweet. Before taking this to the studio, we tested out at shows at about half speed. We loved the song but the slow pace and high register was burning us and the people at the show out. Enter our great producer Kevin Ratterman to fix the problem! He told us to turn up the BPM and detuned the song to make it feel heavier.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Real One</em> features Coffey backed by Dave Tyson on keys, lead guitarist Liam Doyle, Joel &quot;French&quot; Desbois on rhythm guitar, bassist Richard Stanley, and drummer Connor Glen. Guests on the record include vocalist Siânteuse, <a href="https://destroyer.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Destroyer</a>&#39;s Joseph Shabason on sax, and a string quartet arranged by Paul Erlichman of <a href="http://ducksunlimitedband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ducks Unlimited</a>. This will be the Iron Lungs&#39; second outing with <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZUzoJR8afk" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/7ZUzoJR8afk" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Sam Coffey &amp; The Iron Lungs - &quot;Back With The Gang&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Saint John&#39;s experimental agit-noise trio <a href="https://usse.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Usse</a> released a scathing EP last week titled <em>Military Standard</em>. The band commented that the fast-moving, 5-song track set features &quot;more guitars... than in our body of work to date,&quot; listing crust punk pillars like Rudimentary Peni, Amebix, Discharge, and Crass as their &quot;standard bearers&quot; for the release. The 11-minute outing ends with a cover of &quot;Peace/Agency,&quot; originally by the Nova Scotian duo <a href="https://constructionanddestruction.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Construction &amp; Destruction</a> (it lead their 2017 record <em>Noli Timere</em>).</p><p>Downloads of <em>Military Standard</em> include an exclusive dub number not available with the stream. The set&#39;s also available on mailorder as a paper EP with download codes (taking some inspiration from the artistic minds at Pentagon Black, to be sure). Through early December, All proceeds raised from the politically charged set are due for the <a href="https://sipeknekatik.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Sipekne&#39;katik Nation</a> supporting Mi&#39;kmaq Treaty Rights and Moderate Livelihood Fisheries.</p><p><em>Military Standard</em> features Jud Crandall on bass, guitar, drums, and saxophone, Emily Saab on drums, and Sebastian Fleet on guitar. All three members contribute vocals (with Saab notably tackling Coco&#39;s part on the C&amp;D cover). You&#39;ll also hear audio samples from Pierre Trudeau&#39;s 1984 farewell speech threaded through &quot;Indoctrinaires &#39;84&quot; and &quot;Dynastic Bastards.&quot;</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4197260340/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://usse.bandcamp.com/album/military-standard">Military Standard by Usse</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://usse.bandcamp.com/album/military-standard" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Usse - <em>Military Standard</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p><a href="https://ketamines.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ketamines</a>&#39; principal <a href="http://paullawton.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Paul Lawton</a>&#39;s quietly re-emerged with a new musical project dubbed Kill Credo. He debuted the new venture with the lo-fi indie rocker &quot;To Be Seen,&quot; available as a YouTube video starring the artist&#39;s canine companion Noosh.</p><p>Lawton&#39;s left his musical future up in the air since his nascent punk unit <a href="http://dontbothermusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Don&#39;t Bother</a> fell apart. Earlier in the pandemic, he unveiled several archival releases, including Don&#39;t Bother&#39;s aborted 9-song full-length <em>Terminal Phase</em>, and a career-to-date favourites collection dubbed <em>Nothing Remains to be Done</em>. He reflected at the time:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I am starting to make music for the first time since 2018, and I think the 2 year hiatus has me realizing that the only one I ever made music for was myself, and that if even one other person heard the song it was worth it.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Including those mentioned above, Lawton&#39;s played in a swath of punk and punk-adjacent bands between his time in Alberta and Ontario, including <a href="https://centurypalm.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Century Palm</a>, <a href="https://myelinsheaths.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Myelin Sheaths</a>, <a href="https://themobydicks.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Moby Dicks</a>, Radians, Mean Tikes, James Leroy and The Giant, Ran, Endangered Ape, and Light Years. He was behind the now-defunct <a href="https://mammothcave.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mammoth Cave</a> label and co-runs the presently dormant <a href="http://www.pleasencerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pleasence Records</a>. His infamous, industry-tweaking blog Slagging Off once earned him the reputation as &quot;the most hated man in Canadian music,&quot; which is probably why I love him so much.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsIXM_N6S-A" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/bsIXM_N6S-A" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Kill Credo - &quot;To Be Seen&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>With the physical release of <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a>&#39;s <em>How Ill Thy World Is Ordered</em>, one could reasonably assume that some semblance of a typical album cycle would now take hold, putting an end to the Welland singer-songwriter&#39;s astonishingly prolific deluge of digital material these past six months. The pandemic still rages, though, and that assumption has proven utterly false. After the briefest of pauses, Romano returned last week with <em>White Flag</em>, a British Invasion-flavoured solo record and the artist&#39;s 10th release of the year. The 11-song set notably (for me, at least) includes a cover of &quot;Fisherman or Fish,&quot; a song from <a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a>&#39;s 2010 Baby Eagle record <em>Dog Weather</em> (on which Danny played).</p><p>Between <em>How Ill Thy World Is Ordered</em> and the pre-COVID live LP <em>&quot;Okay Wow&quot;</em>, Romano&#39;s released an unparalleled wealth of digital material throughout 2020, both solo and with collaborators. This includes the original full-lengths <em>Dandelion</em>, <em>Content To Point The Way</em>, and <em>&quot;Visions Of The Higher Dream&quot;</em>, plus a high-concept front-to-back cover of Bob Dylan&#39;s <em>Infidels</em>. <em>A Splendour Of Heart</em> found the artist backing Ottawa vocalist <a href="https://www.kellysloan.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Kelly Sloan</a>. The punk scorcher <em>Spider Bite</em> showcased the aforementioned Constantine Steven Lambke. The <em>Super Pollen</em> EP included members of <a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a>, while the extended prog single &quot;Forever Love&#39;s Fool&quot; reached well outside to the You&#39;ve Changed social circle to loop in Tool drummer Daniel Carey.</p><p>On top of all that, Romano (with his brother/drummer Ian Romano and Patrick Bennett of Mountain Dust) recently completed yet another full-length, this one fronted by <a href="https://www.theonlybandever.com/" class="" target=_blank>Alexisonfire</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.wademacneil.com/" class="" target=_blank>Wade MacNeil</a>. Wade described the forthcoming work as &quot;a cozy record for punks that are now hippies who still love Discharge but also now understand that the Grateful Dead are the world&#39;s best band.&quot; We await audio from this one, but you can sneak a few samples from MacNeil&#39;s Instagram account.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1136014344/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com/album/white-flag">White Flag by Daniel Romano</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com/album/white-flag" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Daniel Romano - <em>White Flag</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>The Montreal post-rock luminaries <a href="http://cstrecords.com/fly-pan-am/" class="" target=_blank>Fly Pan Am</a> have a sprawling new single online. &quot;Mirror Cracks Seeking Interiority&quot; is a 10-minute one-off that arrives as part of <a href="http://cstrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constellation Records</a>&#39; Corona Borealis Longplay Singles Series. The band commented on the song, stating in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The social and the mirror is so obvious, being and rediscovering the omnipresent objection of the recovered tendency to the exteriority by a hard, fast object in exteriority. (Re)gaining in self is being personal on temperature differences. Although some aspects of the recovering in exteriority are delineated to a loss of personal autonomy and valorization into pieces.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Fly Pan Am reunited and released <em>C&#39;est ça</em> last year, their first record since 2005&#39;s <em>N&#39;écoutez pas</em>. The new single features Félix Morel on percussion, guitarist Jonathan Parant, and synth work from both Roger Tellier-Craig and Jean-Sébastien Truchy. Electronic tweaks abound, credited to all parties, save Morel.

The set features three outtakes, the 2015 bedroom demo &quot;Raw Deal&quot; standing as the oldest. &quot;Proverbial Grave&quot; originates from the sessions resulting in 2017&#39;s <em>Cellophane</em>, while &quot;Upside Down World&quot; comes from the studio work resulting in last year&#39;s <a href="http://www.drunkensailorrecords.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>Drunken Sailor</a> LP, <em>The Last Offences</em>.

The label bills the Dead Milkmen-influenced set as &quot;6 tracks of Adult Contemporary Punk Rock from members of <a href="https://boot-licker.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bootlicker</a> doing something entirely different.&quot; You can preview three of those tracks at Bandcamp now.</p><p>Neon Taste&#39;s record write-ups always completely pop, and this one&#39;s no different. The Vancouver label described <em>No</em> thusly:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Nutrition the band. Cooking food with radiation. It&#39;s quick. It&#39;s easy. It tastes surprisingly good but it&#39;ll probably kill you in the long run. You&#39;ll die waddling in your consumption.</p><p>While 1/4 of the world are starving, the rest are LIVING, BABY. Overfed on insensitivity. All varnished to excess. &#39;No&#39; is 6 tracks about medication, bleak vulnerability and jabs at existence expressed in short, frantic exclamations. Is it good for you? Who cares. Does that even remotely matter right now?</p><p>We know how fast life/death happens. Blink an eye. Blink again. You won&#39;t find this in your recommended diet so don&#39;t bother to even ask how it relates to your caloric intake. At least shoving these songs in your head is a lot easier and more enjoyable than oatmeal and Yoga or whatever real people do for the privilege of &#39;self care.&#39; It says so on the fucking box. Nutrition. It&#39;s gotta be true. I wouldn&#39;t lie to you would I?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The decidedly-less-whimsical <a href="https://boot-licker.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bootlicker</a> released the UK82-styled <em>How To Love Life</em> this past September.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2212399383/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/album/no-e-p">No E.P. by Nutrition</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/album/no-e-p" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Nutrition - <em>No E.P.</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Toronto indie rock act <a href="https://kiwijr.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Kiwi Jr.</a> recently shared the specifics of their <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a> debut. The band will release <em>Cooler Returns</em> on January 22, 2021 (worldwide on the Seattle institution, except for Canada, where it will carry the &quot;Kiwi Club&quot; label). The band self-produced the record, with <a href="https://www.holyfuckmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Holy Fuck</a>&#39;s Graham Walsh engineering and mixing. Phillip Shaw Bova mastered the set in Ottawa. A florid statement accompanying the news elaborated:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Put together like a thousand-piece puzzle, assembled in flow state through the first dull stretch of quarantine, sanitized singer shuffling to sanitized studio by streetcar, masked like it&#39;s the kind of work where getting recognized means getting killed, <em>Cooler Returns</em> materializes as a sprawling survey from the first few bites of the terrible twenties, an investigative exposé of recent history buried under the headlines &amp; ancient kings buried under parking lots.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The reveal came alongside a video for the title track, directed by <a href="http://seanegertonforeman.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sean Egerton Foreman</a> (Foreman worked with the band on clips from their prior record as well). Vocalist Jeremy Gaudet commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;No one is able to play live shows, so using the latest technology we have replicated the most accurate version possible of what Kiwi Jr. shows once looked like&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can judge that for yourself below.</p><p>Kiwi Jr. last released <em>Football Money</em> in 2018 on Vancouver&#39;s <a href="https://www.mintrecs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mint Records</a>.

That release now includes a fifth track, &quot;All the Queen&#39;s Men.&quot; You can hear it below.</p><p>The new material arrives as part of a push to cover the costs of an MRI for the couple&#39;s ailing cat, Bunny. A detailed write-up at <a href="http://chanceandjackie.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> gets into the particulars of their pet&#39;s mystery ailment, with the couple concluding:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In the last few weeks, we have spent over $3500 for her vet bills without adding in the price of the MRI. We love our cats dearly and we will do whatever we can to make sure Bunny has a comfortable life, whatever the outcome of the MRI is. But without knowing what we are dealing with, the treatment is a bit impossible and simply guesswork. Bunny is an incredibly loving, very special creature who has had a rough start to life, being either feral or abandoned before we adopted her. She was estimated to be around two years old when we welcomed her four years ago, so we really feel that she has a lot of life left to live. We are hoping to put this mystery to rest, with your generous help.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>PRIORS last released <em>New Pleasure</em> and <em>Call For You</em>, an LP and EP respectively, in 2018 for <a href="http://www.slovenly.com/" class="" target=_blank>Slovenly</a>.

The building was home to Journalism and Communications studies, where Chris spent most of his time while at Con U.

In a statement, the label set the stage:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The Year was 2014 and our good pal Jimmy Vapid loaned us his zoom 8 track recorder. &#39;Bachelors Paradise&#39; was home to FLESH RAG, TV FREAKS and even some VAPIDS rehearsals and recordings plus a whole lot more bands and sessions.</p><p>Featured on these recordings are an assortment of friends who were working on songs, stumbled into us working on songs, or just goofing around as we were learning to record ourselves. Bachelors Paradise was our rehearsal space/recording studio, late night after hours party palace, and most importantly it was our home. Hell, I still record here and work on music. Just not as often or as loud. I live there with my girlfriend and daughter. I guess now it&#39;s &#39;Dad&#39;s Paradise.&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>These songs, recorded by Ellis and Flesh Rag/TV Freaks drummer Nathan Burger, were initially released as a cassette through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HammerCityRecords/" class="" target=_blank>Hammer City Records</a>. Proceeds from the set&#39;s online sales will assist in the community hub&#39;s relocation efforts, as the old alley basement location of Hammer City won&#39;t last the pandemic. The <em>Bachelors Paradise</em> sessions feature members from the above-mentioned bands, along with personnel from Get Off The Cop, Noble Savages, Lizzy Bordom, Born Wrong, and the Total Dicks, among others.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3210064396/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://looselipsrecords.bandcamp.com/album/bachelors-paradise">Bachelors Paradise by Bachelor's Paradise</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://looselipsrecords.bandcamp.com/album/bachelors-paradise" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Bachelor&#39;s Paradise - <em>Vol 1</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Hamilton skid-troubadour <a href="http://www.bajohnston.ca/" class="" target=_blank>B.A. Johnston</a> continues to share acoustic gems from his isolation bunker. &quot;Hair in my Donair&quot; is, of course, hardly the artist&#39;s first ode to the spit-roasted Haligonian delicacy.

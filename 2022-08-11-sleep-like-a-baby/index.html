Despite numerous near-misses with COVID, my trip to the east coast for Sappyfest went off without a hitch. I feel adequately centred for the first time since the world fell apart - but the journey created just enough inertia that I&#39;m now nearly a month out from the last regular edition of Some Party. I&#39;ll follow up on Sappy in a future mailing (The Burning Hell made me cry, and I&#39;m not sure how best to contextualize that), so here&#39;s an incomplete smattering of updates haphazardly plucked from my overgrown disaster of an inbox.</p><h3 id=dumb><span class=artist-title><a href="https://dumbband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dumb</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Dropout&quot; / &quot;Sleep Like a Baby&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/kolpsUZcNvE" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Sometimes you just want to climb on your roof and excitedly shout &quot;<a href="https://dumbband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dumb</a> went ska!&quot; at passersby.

The band, better known for wry slack-rock, professed their love for the much-maligned genre in a press release, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We love ska. We break out into ska in practice or even at live shows between songs - we love The Specials, Madness, Skatalites, Desmond Dekker, Vital Disorders, The Upsetters, and much more.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A video featuring both tracks takes that adoration further, mimicking the look and feel of The Specials&#39; video for their 1981 single &quot;Ghost Town.&quot;</p><p>Currently on the road in the US, Dumb features guitarist/vocalist Franco Rossino backed by drummer Pipe Morelli, guitarist Nick Short, and bassist Shelby Vredik. They last issued <em>Club Nites</em>, their second LP for <a href="https://www.mintrecs.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mint Records</a>, in 2019.

Titled <em>Time Is a Car</em>, the set showcases the band&#39;s increasingly mature songwriting (a Lightning McQueen reference notwithstanding). We&#39;ve already heard the title track and &quot;Not Today,&quot; and now you can dig into the soaring, 80s-soaked &quot;Fear That Closes The Heart.&quot;</p><p>The band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The song is about fear, and how the sensation of fear can prevent someone from feeling like they&#39;re living in the moment. We drew influence from Heart and 80s pop rock. The summer after we wrote this song, we went to the Folk on the Rocks music festival in Yellowknife, and participated in a collaborative project called &#39;Emerging Wildly&#39; with Celeigh Cardinal and [Calgarian hip hop duo] <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cartel.madras/" class="" target=_blank>Cartel Madras</a>. When Cartel Madras showed us their videos we immediately knew we wanted to work with them. We were blown away by the cinematography and their vision. We are so happy to present this video that they absolutely knocked out of the park.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Cartel Madras&#39; visuals for &quot;Fear That Closes The Heart&quot; can be found on YouTube.</p><p>This latest batch of songs, recorded with Jordan Koop at The Noise Floor, follows the group&#39;s 2020 sophomore full-length <em>Never Give Up</em>.

LAst week, fresh from their appearance at Sappyfest, they shared the song &quot;Trust&quot; as the final pre-release single. On that track, vocalist Kate Lahey commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Trust&#39; explores a moment where my past and future collided. Love asked me to take a leap of faith into the unknown, while trauma filled me with fear. Working through a claustrophobic sense of flightiness, trust explores the ways in which our past can overwhelm our desire for a better future. In my search for belonging, security and safety, I found myself scared of the very things I long for because of their unfamiliarity. &#39;Trust&#39; is not about trusting someone else with your heart, but about learning to trust yourself. &quot;</p></blockquote><p>The 12-song <em>Hush</em>, which finds the band revelling in quiet moments, lands independently on August 12.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dwfA4-0oXxQ" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=swam><span class=artist-title><a href="https://barelythererecords.bandcamp.com/album/ep" class="" target=_blank>Swam</a></span><span class=media-title><em>EP</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://barelythererecords.bandcamp.com/album/ep" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>On the opposite end of the sonic spectrum, the Newfoundland quartet <a href="https://barelythererecords.bandcamp.com/album/ep" class="" target=_blank>Swam</a> has a new EP (titled, plainly, <em>EP</em>) out through <a href="https://barelythererecords.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Barely There Records</a>, delivering four blasts of brash punk rock played at breakneck speeds.

The band shared:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>OBERON</em> is an exploration of our primordial origins as musicians. We have this murky dank filth deep inside of and can shy away no longer. Born from 90s mixtapes filled with Noothgrush, Crossed Out, His Hero Is Gone, Corrupted, Kiss it Goodbye, Man is the Bastard, it still pounds in us like a jack hammer even after the patches have faded.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new set features three originals alongside a rendition of &quot;Aquarium,&quot; a movement from Camille Saint-Saëns&#39; 1886 suite <em>Le Carnaval des animaux</em> (now best known for its frequent use in film trailers - you&#39;ll know it when you hear it).

The Toronto jangle-pop act issues their new LP <em>Chopper</em> this week on <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a>, and I&#39;m sitting on a pile of unshared pre-release video announcements and other PR ephemera. If you haven&#39;t caught them yet, you can now see clips highlighting &quot;The Extra Sees The Film&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; on YouTube.</p><p>The latter arrived this week with a video from director Laura-Lynn Petrick (Anemone, Matthew &quot;Doc&quot; Dunn). On that song, singer/guitarist Jeremy Gaudet commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Some names are so loaded that I can&#39;t resist inserting them into a song, and Julie Andrews is one. Her name brings up a certain feeling. I didn&#39;t rewatch the movie before writing the song, so it&#39;s from memory, but I knew So Long Farewell and I Have Confidence. There&#39;s this idea of her marriage falling apart after the success of the movie - she was married young to a production designer. I don&#39;t really know how it all went down, but my version makes for good drama. This is Kiwi Jr at our most melodramatic. The song borders on fan-fiction, which is something I usually try to avoid, however this started to get juicy and I had to follow it through.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;The Extra Sees The Film&quot; arrived a few weeks prior, paired with a lyric video. On that track, Gaudet revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song is quite literally a change of pace for us. It&#39;s more chill and a bit darker than previous Kiwi Jr. recordings. It&#39;s a song about whether or not you&#39;re the hero of your own story, or a smaller part of something bigger. It&#39;s bragging that you&#39;re in a movie and inviting all your friends and family, but when it screens, you&#39;re barely an extra in it. A lot of our songs deal with reckoning, this one in particular. It&#39;s what happens after you&#39;ve told your story and the truth comes out later, and everything unravels.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Both tracks showcase the group&#39;s newly retooled, synth-backed sound crafted with producer Dan Boeckner (Operators, Wolf Parade). The new record, the band&#39;s third, follows 2021&#39;s <em>Cooler Returns</em>. Kiwi Jr. features vocalist/guitarist Jeremy Gaudet, guitarist Brian Murphy, bassist Mike Walker, and drummer Brohan Moore.

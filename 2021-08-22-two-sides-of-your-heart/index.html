From that forced idle time, he&#39;s crafted a new solo identity as <a href="https://packratpunk.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Pack Rat</a>. The one-member band&#39;s first record arrives this fall as the full-length <em>Glad To Be Forgotten</em>, a 10-song collection from <a href="http://www.drunkensailorrecords.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>Drunken Sailor Records</a>.</p><p>You can preview the album through &quot;Two Sides of Your Heart,&quot; a high-strung minute-and-a-half of manic synth-punk - cut from a similar cloth as Montreal&#39;s PRIORS and London&#39;s Mononegatives. An accompanying video by director Megan Magdalena clones an entire band of McEachnies to crash through the song together.</p><p>The now-defunct Corner Boys released the <em>Waiting for 2020</em> album in 2019 (an unintentionally portentous title, given how that year turned out).

While it&#39;s a world away from the trio&#39;s noisy roots in the Nova Scotian lo-fi scene, the album&#39;s matter-of-fact, almost indifferent launch feels quite fittingly punk. <em>Come &amp; Go As You Please</em> plays like a 60s garage record, though, clocking in with 12 satisfyingly traditional rock&#39;n&#39;roll songs over 42 minutes. If you dug the throwback vibes of <a href="https://heavenlyblue.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Heavenly Blue</a>, you&#39;ll find a kindred spirit (and indeed half of that band&#39;s lineup) at play here.</p><p>The Halifax group features Adam LeDrew and Justin Crowe, both of the <a href="https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Booji Boys</a>, and their frequent studio collaborator Luke Mumford (<a href="https://negativerage.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Negative Rage</a>, <a href="https://geneticangry.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Genetic Angry</a>, <a href="https://markvodka.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Mark Vodka Group</a>). All three members provide vocals and trade off on instrumentation from song to song. They recorded in both Halifax and Wentworth, Nova Scotia.</p><p><em>Come &amp; Go As You Please</em> arrives following the band&#39;s <em>Left Undone</em> EP. While the trio set those songs to tape in 2017, they didn&#39;t see the light of day until last year amid the collective flood of isolation-era archival releases. LeDrew, Luke &amp; Crowe have been kicking around in one form or another since at least 2013.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3059823682/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://musicbyllc.bandcamp.com/album/come-go-as-you-please">Come &amp; Go As You Please by LeDrew, Luke &amp; Crowe</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=ducks_ltd><span class=artist-title><a href="https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ducks Ltd.</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;How Lonely Are You?&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/mevWrqbfkAQ" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com/track/how-lonely-are-you" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Whenever I stumble across a music video set in Niagara Falls, I feel strangely exposed. It&#39;s like some idealized version of the city requires my spiritual protection from the bizarre kitsch of the tourist district. I&#39;ve got skin in the game whenever someone points a camera at that goddamn hamburger Frankenstein - as if acknowledging this weird town for its infamous weirdness is somehow rude. None of my hang-ups should matter to Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ducks Ltd.</a>, in any case. The jangle-pop act employs a dizzying collage of Niagara oddity to showcase their latest single, &quot;How Lonely Are You?&quot;.</p><p>The video, directed by John Smith, finds Tom McGreevy (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) with Evan Lewis (guitar, bass, drum programming) on either side of the border. McGreevy revealed in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Me and Evan had not been in the same country for about 5 months when this video was shot. He&#39;d been in Australia and I was stuck in Canada owing to the COVID border rules. Those rules made it complicated for him to return to Canada for a minute so he was in the US and Niagara Falls was the closest we could get to each other. Making something that involved us being separated by a border (and a million billion gallons of water), and experiencing two parallel weird tourist towns felt like a good fit with what the song is about. It didn&#39;t make the final cut, but we waved to each other over the falls through binoculars at one point. First time we&#39;d seen each other since February!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>On the song itself, the vocalist commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song is about personal connection in an environment that is hostile to it, and about friendships with people who are physically distant... Me and Evan have both moved around a lot, and have friends in far-off places we don&#39;t see as often as we&#39;d like. In fact, we partly made this record while Evan was living in Australia and I was in Toronto. Some of those friendships are extremely important to me, and the song is kind of about grasping for those lifelines when it&#39;s particularly difficult to believe that things are going to work out, or if there&#39;s even any point in trying.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new single follows &quot;18 Cigarettes&quot; in previewing the record, which arrives October 1 through <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain</a> and <a href="http://carparkrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Carpark</a>. It&#39;s one of several songs on the project to feature backing harmonies from New Zealand indie-pop group The Beths.</p><p><em>Modern Fiction</em> serves as Ducks Ltd.&#39;s full-length debut, following their recently reissued and expanded <em>Get Bleak</em> EP. James Cecil (The Goon Sax, Architecture in Helsinki) produced the new record from Australia.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mevWrqbfkAQ" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=daniel_romano_s_outfit><span class=artist-title><a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano's Outfit</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;The Motions&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/Vlkq53sK2co" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com/track/the-motions" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>The second single from September&#39;s <em>Cobra Poems</em> finds <a href="https://danielromano.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano&#39;s Outfit</a> trying something new - with the band&#39;s namesake songwriter stepping back to let <a href="https://juliannariolinosings.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Julianna Riolino</a> take lead vocals.

Available now on Bandcamp, <em>Shout Out Alex!</em> arrives as a fundraiser for the band&#39;s next studio effort. The set features the band&#39;s Jordan Seccareccia playing solo (at times accompanied by multiple pre-tracked instrumentals and cassette-recorded found sounds). In a curious mix of old and new, the recordings come from a live-streamed performance on Twitch, captured simultaneously to a broken down 70s-era reel-to-reel. The artist revealed in the record&#39;s Bandcamp liner notes:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;So the sound quality here is a little rough. I didn&#39;t think to, for instance, wipe the reel for the first half of the performance, which was recorded over a 1976 new year&#39;s eve radio broadcast counting down the top 20 charting country songs of the year, and which can still be heard faintly behind the first eight tracks. There are some little hiccups of silence and crackling pops that aren&#39;t too intrusive but are definitely there and I just want you to know that.</p><p>The whole performance lasted two hours. I chose eight songs for this release and Rob [McLay] did some mastering and we edited down some of the banter to try to preserve the feel of the performance, even though it does make me a little embarrassed to listen to. Skip the banter if you want.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can find more detail, including the origins of the set&#39;s title, at <a href="https://westelaken.bandcamp.com/album/shout-out-alex" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a>. I&#39;m apparently ageing at such an alarming rate that I understood very little of that story without additional research.</p><p>Seccareccia recorded this material on February 24, 2021, from Markham, Ontario. Westelaken released their thrillingly erratic full-length, <em>The Golden Days are Hard</em>, in 2020.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1087910375/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://westelaken.bandcamp.com/album/shout-out-alex">Shout Out Alex! by Westelaken</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=hubert_lenoir><span class=artist-title><a href="https://hubertlenoir.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hubert Lenoir</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;DIMANCHE SOIR&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/-YxKAP-Tvfg" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://hubertlenoir.bandcamp.com/track/dimanche-soir" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Quebec firebrand <a href="https://hubertlenoir.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hubert Lenoir</a> recently unveiled more about his upcoming record, which now carries the title <em>PICTURA DE IPSE : Musique directe</em>. The album arrives on September 15 through Worse/Terrible and <a href="https://www.simonerecords.net/" class="" target=_blank>Simone Records</a>, featuring 20 songs sprawled across a 54-minute runtime with individual tracks nestled among an array of field recordings and audio interludes. The tracklist reveals a collaboration with the Parisian R&amp;B singer Bonnie Banane and no less than three songs featuring the erratic Montreal art-punk duo <a href="http://crabe.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>CRABE</a>.</p><p>The announcement came alongside the R&amp;B vibes of &quot;DIMANCHE SOIR,&quot; the record&#39;s second single. In a statement, Lenoir commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Coming from a conservative background and going to school in the countryside of Quebec, a lot of my parents&#39; friends or partners thought I was this weirdo queer artsy no good loser, and once I achieved success with my art in the last two-three years, the whole vibe started to change. I remember being so confused by it. The song talks about social pressure coming from your family circle and materialism. How weirdly your social status and wealth can switch the opinion people have on you.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>PICTURA DE IPSE : Musique directe</em> follows the artist&#39;s glam-rock inspired 2018 record <em>Darlène</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YxKAP-Tvfg" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=karloff><span class=artist-title><a href="https://karloffnoise.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Karloff</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Ocean or Other&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/lLjNEh1OMho" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Purchase and purchase at <a href="https://karloffnoise.bandcamp.com/album/karloff" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>There&#39;s a palpable sense of dread to &quot;Ocean or Other,&quot; the first single from <a href="https://karloffnoise.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Karloff</a>&#39;s self-titled full-length.

I made an instant connection with singer/songwriter Adaline, after a night of — well, I can&#39;t remember much. What started as a riff that I had in my voice notes from my guitarist, Kirt, became my gritty hard rock ode to the Women Who Run With the Wolves (shout out to Clarissa Pinkola Estes&#39; book — on the Wild Woman archetype). HOWLER is a celebration and activation of righteous rage, sensuality and protecting the sovereignty of the Divine Feminine through The Empress card in the tarot. With a massive dose of no fucks given, it&#39;s a call to action to take no shit from anyone attempting to rule over our bodies and our souls.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can find the track featured in a new video by director Andrew Hamilton.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYuGuj3Eirk" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=real_sickies><span class=artist-title><a href="https://realsickies.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Real Sickies</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Destructive Nights&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/3XzBdvSTdTg" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://realsickies.bandcamp.com/track/destructive-nights" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Edmonton&#39;s <a href="https://realsickies.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Real Sickies</a> has a new video online celebrating &quot;Destructive Nights,&quot; a track from their recent <em>Love is for Lovers</em> LP.

In a statement, the Toronto group commented on their contributions to the split:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;These songs are from a snapshot of where we are as a band in the current global picture. &#39;Knockout Saturday&#39; is about our local reggae/ska/soul DJ night here in Toronto that was a staple every month, prior to the pandemic, and what it meant to meet up with friends, listen to great music, and have a good time. &#39;We Won&#39;t Back Down&#39; is a song about how fascist groups like the Proud Boys have suddenly lost their nerve and started retreating underground. Rough Cuts is about the Oi! scene in general and how our focus is to write music that we enjoy and tells a story that is important to us...&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Rough Cuts recorded with Byron Pickles at The Farmhouse in Toronto, with Graham Riddle mastering at Calgary&#39;s Wayfarer Sound.

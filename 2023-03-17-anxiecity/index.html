Last week the group, led by Anishinaabe vocalist Tashiina Buswa, shared the lo-fi slack-rock title track of <em>Indian Cowboy</em>, paired with a charming video from director Sasha Khalimonova. We&#39;ve seen Sasha&#39;s work here before, visualizing songs from the Nora Kelly Band and Marlaena Moore. If you&#39;re a fan of the cooly detached Toronto quartet Packs, you&#39;ll certainly dig the languid vibes at play here.</p><p>The band provided some background on the hooky single in a press release, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Indian Cowboy&#39; takes the old Hollywood trope of Cowboys and Indians, and injects it with nuance. Growing up with a foot in two worlds, one where Indigenous identity is held sacred and one where colonialism works to tear it down, Buswa muses on the duality of organized religion / Indigeneity, and staying connected to your culture in a world designed to destroy it. &#39;You want it? You got your Indian Cowboy!&#39; she sings in exasperation at the end of the track, defeated, yet with a secret, triumphant sense of beating the system at its own game.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Love Language features Tashiina on vocals and guitar, backed by drummer Lan Thockchom, guitarist Billy Riley (<a href="https://bloomingseason.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Blooming Season</a>), and bassist Lucas CA. The group recorded with <a href="https://faithhealer.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Faith Healer</a>&#39;s Renny Wilson at Value Sound.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rbd52Z3F764" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=prosthetic_bung><span class=artist-title><a href="https://prostheticbung.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Prosthetic Bung</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Futureless Throb: Live In Japan, 1983</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://prostheticbung.bandcamp.com/album/futureless-throb-live-in-japan-1983" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Let&#39;s clarify a few things regarding <em>Futureless Throb: Live In Japan, 1983</em>, the new release from Toronto noise-punk/no-wave duo <a href="https://prostheticbung.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Prosthetic Bung</a>. Mainly, the group likely hasn&#39;t recorded anything live in Japan, and certainly not in 1983. The best I can tell, they first surfaced online just this past January. The group&#39;s lo-fi thump lends itself well to the fake live shtick, though, and somehow even the crowd noise piped over the 5-songs never outlasts its welcome. It helps that I find the group&#39;s grimy racket wonderfully endearing. You can find the five-song, 19-minute set in one unbroken digital blob at Bandcamp or dubbed to tape by <a href="https://thehillsaredead.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Hills Are Dead Records</a>. If you grab a cassette, you&#39;ll find the band&#39;s debut single, &quot;Hey Baby, It&#39;s.... Prosthetic Bung,&quot; tacked on as a bonus track.</p><p>Prosthetic Bung pairs guitarist/vocalist Steff and drummer/bassist/synth-player Zach. <em>Futureless Throb</em> is precisely the type of gnarly nonsense this newsletter exists to share.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=915601031/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://prostheticbung.bandcamp.com/album/futureless-throb-live-in-japan-1983">Futureless Throb: Live In Japan, 1983 by Prosthetic Bung</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=smaller_hearts><span class=artist-title><a href="https://smallerhearts.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Smaller Hearts</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Belts and Braces&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/nndo-78wN84" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://smallerhearts.bandcamp.com/track/belts-and-braces-2" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Dartmouth electro-pop duo <a href="https://smallerhearts.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Smaller Hearts</a> recently announced <em>Rock and Roll Was Here to Stay</em>, a new 11-song full-length due out April 21. It clocks in as the band&#39;s fourth LP, following 2021&#39;s <em>Attention</em>. We&#39;ve already heard the album-opening &quot;Sleeper Agent,&quot; but you can now preview the brisk &quot;Belts and Braces.&quot; The band shared a bit about the song&#39;s construction and inspiration in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Belts and Braces is a departure from our usual songwriting approach: most of our songs are created by starting with synthesizers — a line or a sound that we create or noodle out on a keyboard. This one was written first on bass guitar, jammed out in our basement in the summer of 2021 shortly after our last album <em>Attention</em> was released. We added synths and drums until it became more of a Smaller Hearts sound.</p><p>The title came much later, when Kristina was talking to a friend who described someone as taking a &#39;belts and braces&#39; approach to something. She&#39;d never heard the expression before: the act of taking extra—probably unnecessary—steps to make sure something goes as planned or to prevent a problem. (In other words, wearing both a belt and suspenders to keep your pants up)/ But as a sometimes-obsessive overplanner, she found it relatable. There&#39;s an intentional urgency in the bass line; the keyboard part that comes in halfway sounds like a bit of an alarm—an attempt to mirror the anxiety of thinking and thinking and thinking through the same thing. But then the song turns that on its head by coming to a short quick conclusion, intentionally kicking that endlessly anxious churning by decisively, confidently ending.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can pick up a copy of the LP through the Halifax label <a href="https://noyesrecords.limitedrun.com" class="" target=_blank>Noyes Records</a>. Smaller Hearts features Kristina Parlee (of <a href="https://themaynards.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Maynards</a> and, most recently, <a href="https://shoulderseasonhfx.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Shoulder Season</a>) paired with Ron Bates, a veteran of Moon Socket, <a href="https://orangeglass.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Orange Glass</a> and Elevator To Hell.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nndo-78wN84" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=mononegatives><span class=artist-title><a href="https://mononegatives.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mononegatives</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Cro-Magnon&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://mononegatives.bandcamp.com/album/cro-magnon" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>London, Ontario synth-punks <a href="https://mononegatives.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Mononegatives</a> unexpectedly slow it down on their new single &quot;Cro-Magnon,&quot; an incredible stretch given that the group almost exclusively delivers their electro-fuzz at breakneck speeds. The track&#39;s our second preview of the forthcoming <em>Crossing Visual Field</em> LP, due April 21 through the UK&#39;s <a href="http://www.nofrontteeth.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>No Front Teeth</a> and LA design collective <a href="https://dowdrecords.com" class="" target=_blank>Dowd Records</a>. The band comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Cro-Magnon is a bass driven cacophony of sounds new and old. If you have seen us live anytime since shows came back you have heard this track, if not you will hear it here for the first time. Pre human expression in these almost post human times. Listen on a phone while living in a cave.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Dowd again went all out with the 7&quot; release, and the game included with the record will surely throw audiophile gear nuts into a tailspin. The wax comes packaged with cardboard cutouts of the band (and some skeletons) which you stand upon the spinning record. It&#39;s your goal to rescue the group from their looming demise with the help of a tiny metal hook. To keep things interesting, the &quot;easy mode&quot; a-side of the 7&quot; features the song cut at 33 RPM, while the flip has it racing by at 45 RPM for added difficulty. Dowd&#39;s collecting social media videos of fans playing the now-sold-out game for prizes --- perhaps the most laudably whimsical marketing campaign I&#39;ve seen in ages. Hat tip to them.</p><p>Mononegatives features <a href="http://robbiebrake.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Robbie Brake</a> (<a href="https://isolationparty.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Isölation Party</a>) on guitar, synth, and vocals, with drummer David Cereghini, and bassist Aaron Wallis.

The St. John&#39;s bred, Toronto-based melodic hardcore band last put out a record in 2016, and suffice to say, we&#39;ve all been through some shit since then. The group returns on April 21 with the appropriately-titled <em>Rebuilding Year</em>, a new 14-song collection for the venerable <a href="https://stomprecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stomp Records</a>. You can preview the new set with the single &quot;Moonstones,&quot; a song steeped in early 90s west coast punk influences. On it, vocalist Patty O&#39;Lantern revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I was listening to a lot of Dag Nasty <em>Can I Say</em> at the time. This was inspired by &#39;Values Her&#39;e&#39; in a lot of ways. Lyrically it&#39;s a personal anthem about when the intimate promises we often make to the ones we love can just fall apart no matter how much you&#39;re doing to try to hold them together. Thematically I think that&#39;s in line with the entire record.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://crustymedia.ca" class="" target=_blank>Michael Crusty</a> (The Black Halos, Danko Jones) directed the &quot;Moonstones&quot; video, playing now on YouTube. The band recorded with Steve Rizun (The Flatliners, Choices Made) at Drive Studios in Toronto. <em>Rebuilding Year</em> lands as the group&#39;s fourth long player, following up from their 2016 Stomp LP <em>Sanguine</em>. Brutal Youth finds O&#39;Lantern backed by drummer Dustin Campbell, bassist Kyle Hynes, and guitarist Greg Hounsel.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzMKAlHqvpM" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=double_date_with_death><span class=artist-title><a href="https://doubledatewithdeath.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Double Date with Death</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Labyrinthe&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/kMaqduFmhVc" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://doubledatewithdeath.bandcamp.com/album/labyrinthe" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Last week Montreal psych rockers <a href="https://doubledatewithdeath.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Double Date with Death</a> offered a third preview of their new LP <em>Portraits</em> through the hypnotic &quot;Labyrinthe.&quot; Inspired by the famous hedge maze from Stanley Kubrick&#39;s <em>The Shining</em>, the track arrived alongside a trippy video from LA-based neo-psychedelic artist <a href="https://vinylwilliams.com/" class="" target=_blank>Vinyl Williams</a>.</p><p>The tune also features a notable collaboration between DDWD and Anna Frances Meyer of Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://deuxluxes.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Deuxluxes</a>.

Symphony Orchestra self-produced the album, with Rault serving as the project&#39;s rhythm section and lead vocalist while Turnbull handled guitar and lyrics. Steve Chahley and Tony Price mixed the results.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2417899843/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://symphonyorchestramusic.bandcamp.com/album/radiant-music">Radiant Music by Symphony Orchestra </a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=citizen_rage><span class=artist-title><a href="https://citizenragehardcore.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Citizen Rage</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;What&#39;s It To You?&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://cursedblessingsrecords.bandcamp.com/track/whats-it-to-you" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Calgary hardcore act <a href="https://citizenragehardcore.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Citizen Rage</a> has teamed up with <a href="https://cursedblessingsrecords.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Cursed Blessings Records</a> to issue their new LP <em>Harsh Reality</em>.

It&#39;s our way of standing up to them. Whether it&#39;s the government, the clergy or anyone else who wants to say, &#39;my way is the only right way and my morals should decide how you get to live.&#39; It&#39;s a &#39;fuck you&#39; to those bigots who are so scared of things they don&#39;t understand, that they&#39;ll yell and scream and protest people&#39;s right to exist as themselves.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band recorded with Jamie Kovalsky at Calgary&#39;s Prohibitor Studios, with <a href="https://realsickies.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Real Sickies</a>&#39; Rob Lawless mixing and mastering at The Physics Lab.

You can preview the introspective album-openers &quot;Head Shrunk&quot; and &quot;Sad Dumb Game&quot; online now. While the former clearly grapples with matters of therapy, the latter bears some explanation:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I wrote &#39;Sad Dumb Game&#39; as a reflection of our intentions versus our actions. We&#39;re in a weird spot where two identities exist: your online persona and the real you. Lots of people get to see the online you, the one that&#39;s carefully crafted, massaged, edited. A small fraction get to see the real person that exists outside the algorithms and edited rewrites. &#39;Sad Dumb Game&#39; is about that performative dance, that editing process. It&#39;s about the you that only exists on a screen somewhere versus who we really are.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Thomson remains the band&#39;s only constant and openly questions the project&#39;s future in the same press release, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;If the band is done and this is the final record, then I&#39;m happy with this one being the last one. Some of the best and worst moments of my life are tied to this band. Part of me has been trying to get out of it since I started it, but it always drags me back in. I&#39;ve realized that I&#39;ll probably never be able to walk away from it completely. Single Mothers is tied to my soul at this point, for better or worse. It has its claws in my heart.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Thomson&#39;s restlessness was on full display during the pandemic, through which he emerged as a prolific home producer. Over the last few years, he issued dozens of recordings under an ever-shifting list of stage names, including The Drew Thomson Foundation, No Idea Head, SM WorseWorld, and SM Worldwide.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3697278634/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://singlemothersband.bandcamp.com/album/roy">Roy by SINGLE MOTHERS</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=hippie_hourrah><span class=artist-title><a href="https://hippiehourrah.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hippie Hourrah</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Pinceau au tombeau&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/IVjIyuJ_mng" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://hippiehourrah.bandcamp.com/album/exposition-individuelle" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Montreal psych trio <a href="https://hippiehourrah.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hippie Hourrah</a> unveiled their new LP this week. <em>Exposition individuelle</em> features 14 psych-pop explorations, including the recent &quot;Or aux dents&quot; song cycle and last fall&#39;s &quot;Les murs&quot; single.

It&#39;s also the super tough mom genes that get us through that day to day of ups and downs and emotional manipulations and breakthroughs and pure joy that come with our role as matriarch. My babies were a great gift to me and I wouldn&#39;t change anything, but as I try to balance motherhood with everything that I had before, things can&#39;t help but fall off the scales. Moms are just out here doing their best, loving their babies, and trying to make time for loving themselves too.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The 15-song <em>Unconditional Love In Hi-Fi</em> arrives on April 14. It finds Louie paired with drummer Sean Hamilton. The duo recorded this song during sessions last August at Chestermere, AB&#39;s OCL Studios with engineer Josh Gwilliam.

Leather jackets, a rippling fringe and tattoos. Millennial love is wholesome af, shared memes and the heat death of the planet, but first, let&#39;s split an ice cream cone to cool down, to come down. Bikes, beers, babes. Rock and roll for modern times, for modern love.

I would write them and work them out with Julie and the other guys before we recorded. So the first recorded version of many of those songs is the one that got released. I did end up finding a couple though...&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can find the collection and the full write-up over at the Rick White Archive.

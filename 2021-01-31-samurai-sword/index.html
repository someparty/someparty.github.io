The 13-song set&#39;s due on March 19 from <a href="http://www.flemisheye.com/" class="" target=_blank>Flemish Eye</a> in Canada and <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a> elsewhere. The news arrived alongside a video for the single &quot;Samurai Sword,&quot; animated by the artist. It&#39;s a welcome return to the bizarre, strangely organic realms VanGaalen so frequently revisits in his visual work. The clip adds a minute and a half to the song&#39;s album runtime, framing the song&#39;s narrative with a cartoon set in an alien thrift store (and sneaking in more than a few clever references - we see you, Dog Day LP).</p><p>In a statement VanGaalen commented on the song, which features a ramshackle metallophone built from scrap copper pipe:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I had just ripped a bunch of old leaking copper pipe out of my basement in a reno job that I jumped into willy nilly. Realizing how magical the pipes sounded, I put them on some dirty styrofoam and banged out the janky beat that introduces the song! Garbage is life... It just spilled out in a couple minutes. I didn&#39;t try to stop it because I was smiling like I was just cruising through my neighbourhood. Simple like a sandbox. An ode to the simplicity. It&#39;s hard to let things be simple. But simple is easy on the mind, and being jovial in song is something I find really difficult. Why? What?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The &quot;Samurai Sword&quot; video (which premiered through Adult Swim) follows a good-natured warrior searching for their misplaced weapon. I don&#39;t know about you, but this is precisely the level of oddball nonsense I need to get through this unreal winter. VanGaalen spoke on the production as well:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I was drawing black and white plant backgrounds for this song because of the great old samurai movies of the past. I like how nature sometimes takes the lead. I was getting all knotted in my mind about the sky. I looked at my dad&#39;s watercolour paintings of a sky, and felt like I couldn&#39;t get the feel right. So, I just borrowed his sky for a scene and then I realized that my dad&#39;s paintings were perfect and already full of real life energy. I used them to finish the video and felt like we got to go on this quest together. In my mind. Fuck time.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Chad recorded the new album, the proper follow-up to 2017&#39;s <em>Light Information</em>, at his Yoko Eno Studio in Calgary. Ryan Morey (Wares, Daniel Romano, Yves Jarvis) mastered the set in Montreal.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, VanGaalen&#39;s released a series of archival releases, including the instrumental set <em>NTH</em>, the improvisational synth-focused <em>Lost Harmonies</em>, and the <em>Odds &amp; Sods 2</em> collection.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7UqrMWDUSI" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=headcheese><span class=artist-title><a href="https://headcheesepunk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Headcheese</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Talk To The Therapist&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/album/headcheese" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://www.neontasterecords.ca" class="" target=_blank>Neon Taste Records</a> has an LP lined up from Kamloops&#39; thrillingly sardonic punk group <a href="https://headcheesepunk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Headcheese</a>. The Vancouver label, home of bands like Dead Cells, Nutrition, and Bootlicker, recently shared two new tracks from the release: &quot;Talk to the Therapist&quot; and &quot;Po Po.&quot; Label-head Josh Nickel shared his thoughts on the record through his Neon Waste webzine:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;To our ears, the sounds of White Pigs with Brutal Knights cuts through in a way that I don&#39;t hear too often from most bands releasing records these days and Headcheese kicks this style with precision. Callous, pissed hardcore with a good helping of humor to keep it light. Back when I was getting into punk and hardcore as a little piece of shit, it was records like this that grabbed me first because they were fun and wild. Now that I&#39;m an old piece of shit I&#39;m just as excited when I hear them and even more to be in a position to put these things out. Hope you&#39;ll agree!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While a release date hasn&#39;t yet been announced, you check with the label on <a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> this Friday to get in on the pre-order.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4158705257/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/album/headcheese">Headcheese by Headcheese</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=freelove_fenner><span class=artist-title><a href="https://freelovefenner.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Freelove Fenner</a></span><span class=media-title><em>The Punishment Zone</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://freelovefenner.bandcamp.com/album/the-punishment-zone" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Meticulous Montreal art-pop duo <a href="https://freelovefenner.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Freelove Fenner</a> returns this week with their first new LP since 2013&#39;s <em>Do Not Affect A Breezy Manner</em>.

You&#39;ve undoubtedly seen that space mentioned here before, as Woodford worked on recent favourites from Tough Age, Deliluh, Night Lunch, and Bleu Nuit, to name a few. Moone&#39;s write-up highlights the Bottle Garden&#39;s role in crafting the band&#39;s pleasantly organic output:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The group&#39;s workshop is the strictly analog Bottle Garden Studio, a small room full of tape machines and homemade equipment that is integral to the group&#39;s sound and process. Avoiding 21st century technology not out of any sort of snobbery or nostalgia but rather a desire to avoid the work habits inherent with contemporary tools, the band embraces the different results that come with a slower, more tactile process: the happy accidents; the absence of visual stimuli (no screens); the difficulty in attaining high gloss finishes.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1073430659/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://freelovefenner.bandcamp.com/album/the-punishment-zone">The Punishment Zone by Freelove Fenner</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=dogsnotgods><span class=artist-title><a href="https://dogsnotgods.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>DogsnotGods</a></span><span class=media-title><em>EP1</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://dogsnotgods.bandcamp.com/album/dogsnotgods" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://dogsnotgods.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>DogsnotGods</a> is a five-piece Moncton punk group lead by <a href="https://fearoflipstick.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fear of Lipstick</a>&#39;s Jerms O&#39;Neill.

I&#39;m a little unclear on these releases&#39; exact chronological order, but the band commented that they recorded EP1 live-off-the-floor of the Virus 19 studio in early January.

In their press release, they commented on how the band&#39;s evolved their sound this second time out:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;On Full Well the band shifts to a more polished sound while retaining their brand of eccentric art-punk. This is an album about coming to terms with the limits of one&#39;s understanding. Informed by a close family member&#39;s manic episode, another family member&#39;s deteriorating memory, the Hebrew bible, and a university graduation, the words grapple with the confusion induced by an increasingly complex and perplexing world. And although the words are sung with the fervent conviction of a street side sermon, it is a conviction that quickly reveals itself as hollow as the words devolve into contradiction, irony, and frustrated rambling. Fittingly, the instrumental foundation for these rambling lyrics shifts restlessly throughout Full Well as the band moves abruptly through time, tempo, and mood changes, never allowing the listener the comfort of knowing full well where they are, or where they may be going next.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Full Well</em> follows up on Fitness&#39; 2018 debut <em>-ing</em> (to be read aloud as &quot;dashing&quot; - you get it).</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z3_GClPcNh8" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=the_obgms><span class=artist-title><a href="https://theobgms.com/" class="" target=_blank>The OBGMs</a></span><span class=media-title><em>The Outsah Tape</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Listen at <a href="https://youtu.be/2T5punB2FWQ" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto punk trio <a href="https://theobgms.com/" class="" target=_blank>The OBGMs</a> recently revisited the opening track to 2020&#39;s <em>The Ends</em> with a pair of remixes. <em>The Outsah Tape</em> features two new takes on &quot;Outsah,&quot; one pairing drummer Cola H. with the New York hip-hop/rock hybrid <a href="https://www.oxymorrons.com" class="" target=_blank>Oxymorrons</a>, and the second featuring Chicago rapper <a href="https://www.instagram.com/femdotdotcom" class="" target=_blank>femdot.</a> joining forces with the OBGMs&#39; frequent collaborator <a href="https://www.ctsecond.com/" class="" target=_blank>Clairmont The Second</a>.

As with the record&#39;s earlier singles, it provides another moving showcase for Tamara Lindeman&#39;s delicate and haunting vocals. The singer-songwriter commented on the track, which arrived alongside a new video:</p><blockquote><p>&quot; &#39;Parking Lot&#39; is my strange gentle disco song about a humble encounter with a bird and being tired and being in love, and being heartbroken in ways I didn&#39;t quite yet understand. I don&#39;t fully know how everything connects in this song other than it obviously does. I wanted to make the recording very passionate and beautiful while also being very muscular while also being very gentle, and so I did.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>On this, her fifth record, Lindeman&#39;s band includes drummer Kieran Adams, guitarist Christine Bougie, bassist Ben Whiteley, Ryan Driver on the flute, Johnny Spence on piano, and <a href="https://theconstantines.wordpress.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constantines</a>&#39; Will Kidman on additional percussion.</p><p>If you missed Allison Hussey&#39;s recent deep dive for <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/profile/the-weather-station-ignorance-interview/" class="" target=_blank>Pitchfork</a> into Tamara&#39;s climate activism and how it&#39;s reflected in her art, make sure you give it a read. <em>Ignorance</em> arrives this Friday.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gDcxg56nZAo" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=gloin><span class=artist-title><a href="https://gloinxo.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Gloin</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Live Monster</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/lclyirGSD80" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://gloinxo.bandcamp.com/album/live-monster" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto darkwave four-piece <a href="https://gloinxo.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Gloin</a> has a new set of live recordings online. <em>Live Monster</em> features live-to-tape renditions of material from the band&#39;s 2019 EP <em>Soft Monster</em>, captured in January of 2020 during a weekend trip to Northern Ontario.

The group recorded and infrequently toured between 1980 and 1983, sharing the stage during their brief run with legends like the Subhumans, Black Flag, and the Dead Kennedys. Neos will see their discography collected later this year as a new LP titled <em>Three Teens Hellbent On Speed</em>. Before that arrives, though, the label&#39;s repressing the band&#39;s posthumous demos collection <em>Fight With Donald</em> as an 18-song 7&quot; (when you play this fast, that&#39;s a perfectly reasonable amount of material to fit on an EP). You can stream the song &quot;Sleeve,&quot; the only track from the 45 to reappear on the album, at Bandcamp. The record ships out on April 15.</p><p><em>Fight With Donald</em> originally surfaced in 1995 through Break Even and <a href="https://schizophrenicrex.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Schizophrenic Records</a>, collecting rehearsal tape material tracked in 1980. During their original run, Neos&#39; only official releases were the 1982 EPs <em>End All Discrimination</em> and <em>Hassibah Gets The Martian Brain Squeeze</em>.</p><p>Fun fact - the <em>Hassibah</em> track &quot;(Almost) Typical, Obligatory Anti-Government Song&quot; was repurposed by NOFX for their <em>Fuck The Kids</em> EP as &quot;Stupid Canadians&quot; (with Eric Melvin on vocals).</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2703325990/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://supremeecho.bandcamp.com/album/neos">Neos by Supreme Echo</a></iframe> </body></html> </div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2021-02-07-year-of-the-horse/" rel=next title="Next article: Year of the Horse"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Year of the Horse</div> <div class=pagination-date>February 7, 2021</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2021-01-24-half-rich-loner/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Half Rich Loner"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Half Rich Loner</div> <div class=pagination-date>January 24, 2021</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

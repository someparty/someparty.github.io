So much for my weekly schedule, not to mention a strong showing for the inglorious fifth anniversary of Some Party. I can&#39;t lie and say that my increasing inability to meet self-imposed deadlines hasn&#39;t become a stressor. While I&#39;m still grappling with that, it does have me reflecting on one of my initial motivations for the newsletter. I started writing weekly to unhitch myself from the daily grind of music coverage - to get away from the compulsion to break stories and rush out search-optimized nothings before a story grew stale. I hammered that home in the title of the very first edition, lifting a lyric from Daniel Romano&#39;s &quot;Modern Pressure.&quot; &quot;React to it at your leisure&quot; was as much an instruction for readers as it was a cautionary mantra for me. Perhaps I should take my own advice and relax a little.</p><p>Hell, by my count, there&#39;s been 241 issues of Some Party over these five years - around 48 a year, not counting the odd extra feature. That&#39;s not too far off the mark, all things considered.</p><p>In that spirit, here&#39;s an update that&#39;s neither timely nor comprehensive. Proudly so.</p><h3 id=the_flatliners><span class=artist-title><a href="https://www.theflatliners.com" class="" target=_blank>The Flatliners</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Performative Hours&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/iKH_LtQDlyc" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://theflatliners.bandcamp.com/track/performative-hours" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>The 2017 roots of this newsletter coincided with the release of <em>Inviting Light</em>, the then-most recent full-length from the Toronto punk group <a href="https://www.theflatliners.com" class="" target=_blank>The Flatliners</a>. While I, like much of the Punknews crowd, wrestled with that album&#39;s clean pop sensibilities - we never imagined how much of an impact frontman Chris Cresswell would soon have outside of the group. By the fall of that year, he was on stage, unplanned, with Gainesville legends Hot Water Music, filling in for that band&#39;s ailing Chris Wollard in front of a hometown crowd at The Fest. As Wollard pulled back from the band&#39;s live commitments, Chris proved to be more than a mere ringer - appearing to this day as a fully-fledged contributor to the beloved punk group. Look no further than last week, when the band showcased the Cresswell-fronted &quot;<a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/77498/hot-water-music-release-turn-the-dial-video" class="" target=_blank>Turn The Dial</a>&quot; as a single from their new studio album.</p><p>Of course, the pandemic dominated the years since that unlikely pairing came together, a further impediment for whatever The Flatliners&#39; next move would be. They&#39;d spend nearly 600 days apart before convening to record <em>New Ruin</em> - their most extended break since emerging on the ska-punk circuit back in 2002. That should provide as clean a slate as any, but even with <em>Inviting Light</em> so far removed, it&#39;s surprising how aggressive the band sounds on &quot;Performative Hours,&quot; <em>New Ruin</em>&#39;s first single. In a press release, Cresswell commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;There&#39;s a desperation that&#39;s run rampant within us as people, and it&#39;s the need to be validated. A shadow of what&#39;s really real, a version of the truth, a performance at all hours. As the world around us grows more mechanically able to connect, us as people will abuse that power to simply brag or complain, feverishly attempting to create a moment instead of just enjoying one. It feels as though we&#39;ve found ourselves in an age of insincerity, with people putting in the hours for nothing more than upholding an image. Time now ticks in performative hours.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Director Mitch Barnes (The Dirty Nil) showcases the song in a frenzied, satirical music video starring Rodrigo Fernandez-Stoll (Kim&#39;s Conveniences, Baroness Von Sketch Show) as a hard-drinking, disaster-prone variety show host. The band, Cresswell with drummer Paul Ramirez, bassist Jon Darbey, and guitarist Scott Brigham, performs as the television program quickly unravels.</p><p>The new record lands on August 5 from <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a> in Canada and <a href="http://www.fatwreck.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fat Wreck Chords</a> elsewhere. The group self-produced at Toronto&#39;s Noble Street Studios and Genesis Sound with engineer Matt Snell. Anton DeLost mixed the record with Jason Livermore mastering at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado. <em>New Ruin</em> lands as The Flatliners&#39; sixth studio album, arriving in conjunction with their 20th anniversary.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iKH_LtQDlyc" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=sammy_j_scorpion><span class=artist-title><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sammy.j.scorpion/" class="" target=_blank>Sammy J.

While you can find the six-song release on major streaming platforms now, take a moment and circle back to the single &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot; Scorpion, born Sammy Lewis, spoke to the <a href="https://www.scenepointblank.com/news/videos/2022/05/08/spb-premiere-happy-birthday-sammy-j-scorpion/" class="" target=_blank>Scene Point Blank</a> early in May, revealing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song is about the melancholy feeling of growing older and how time can feel like it&#39;s quickly passing. I guess you could say, the years start coming and they don&#39;t stop coming...</p><p>You can hear me playing a cheap plastic harmonica on this track. I had a nicer one that sounded great and was way easier to play, but something about how challenging it was and how breathy and labored it sounded brought some life to the song. When you&#39;re recording music I think there&#39;s a tendency to make everything sound flawless. But sometimes there&#39;s magic in the little imperfections.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Lewis recorded and mixed at his home studio, with <a href="http://organeyes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Organ Eyes</a>&#39; Cam Steacy mastering.

The five-song <em>Big Pharma</em> features a guest on each track, a roster that includes Cadence Weapon, Michael Peter Olsen, Sunnsetter, and Jasmine Trails. You can hear the delicate lead single &quot;Astum&quot; now, a song that includes an appearance from Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg scholar and musician <a href="https://leannesimpson.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Leanne Betasamosake Simpson</a>. On the track, Monkman commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Astum was the first Cree word that my late father, Glen Olsen, taught me as a child. It means &#39;hurry up&#39; or &#39;quickly&#39;. He would walk in front of me and at the door say &#39;Astum, Daniel! Astum!&#39; Thinking of it as a game, I&#39;d run towards him as quickly as possible. I thought about this and what the word means in my now adult life, especially now in my musical career. Passing down language was something that I prayed for as a kid. I remember wanting to attend the reservation school to learn but our Ojibway teacher disappeared one month earlier and never came back.</p><p>&#39;Astum&#39; also touches on active addiction and the challenges that it brings to an individual. While in active addiction, it&#39;s extremely difficult to function in the known society and it leaves you feeling even more lost. I reflect on how it&#39;s really sad and you watch a lot of good people leave because it&#39;s impossible to keep a firm grasp on reality. You&#39;re longing for a great relationship but know it could never happen because you&#39;re constantly trying to numb out past traumas.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The EP&#39;s due June 21 from <a href="https://paperbagrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Paper Bag</a>, following up on 2020&#39;s <em>Bleached Wavves</em>.

While cowbells and woodblocks dance in and out of its unique angular beat, repetitive riffs and catchy synthesizer lines ensure that listeners are hypnotized, ultimately taken into an easter egg-ridden 2D metaphysical labyrinth where psychedelic musical bliss awaits.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band recorded with Samuel Gemme engineering at Gamma Recording Studio (Corridor, Anemone). La Sécurité features Éliane Viens-Synnott on lead vocals and synth, Félix Bélisle on bass, Kenny Smith on drums, Laurence-Anne on guitar and synth, and Melissa Di Menna also on guitar and synth. The group features current and former members of Choses Sauvages, Laurence-Anne, Jesuslesfilles, Silver Dapple, DATES, and Pressure Pin.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/95kkLl9SknM" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=never_plenty><span class=artist-title><a href="https://neverplenty.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Never Plenty</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Tranquilized&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://neverplenty.bandcamp.com/track/tranquilized" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Vancouver&#39;s <a href="https://neverplenty.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Never Plenty</a> arrives fully formed on their confident and distinctive debut single, &quot;Tranquilized.&quot; The song bounces along with a gleeful helping of DEVO weirdness, punctuated by reverb-washed vocals delivered with an almost childlike yelp.

Chris Beeble and Jason Livermore mixed and mastered the new songs at the aforementioned Blasting Room.

The Nova Scotian indie-pop group issued their 10-song debut in its entirety at the end of May. The release also unveiled the album highlight &quot;Revisionist History,&quot; perhaps the most traditionally punk track in their varied repertoire. Foster commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;A coping mechanism I have, like a lot of people, is to convince myself I didn&#39;t want the thing I failed to get, whether it&#39;s a relationship, job, or what have you. It&#39;s a kind of revisionist history where you edit your real feelings to pretend you never cared. I actually think it&#39;s a fine coping mechanism, but it can still be uncomfortable to confront.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>On the recording, she revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I had to work on the yell so I didn&#39;t just sound like a mom yelling about cleaning your room. It took a few tries, and there was a lot of laughing in the studio. That said, we all love the recent pop punk revival and figured this would be a good track to step out on.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Like Shoulder Season above, Safeword also recorded at Ocean Floor with Charles Austin, also working with Franc Lopes.

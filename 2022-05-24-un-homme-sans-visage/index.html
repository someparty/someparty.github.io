The track features Robert backed by Samuel Gogoux on drums, Mathieu Cloutier on bass, Corridor&#39;s Julian Perreault on lap steel guitar, and Emmanuel Ethier on mellotron.

On the song, the band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Blip on the Radar&#39; is a look into the mind of someone battling addiction and depression. Going at it alone in an existence supported by the worst drug dealer of them all... the doctors that feed them pills and false hope. The sky opened up and they finally realized that it was always up to them to dig themselves out of the dirt, and punk music and sobriety were a means to an end.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The band worked with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/belvedere669/" class="" target=_blank>Belvedere</a>&#39;s Casey Lewis at Echo Base Studio. Whenever it arrives, the new album follows up the group&#39;s early 2021 EP <em>Leapfrog</em>. Trashed Ambulance features Josh Hauta, Jason (Ozone) Ezeard, and Riley Bourne.

You can now preview <em>Floating Through The Wonderwave</em> with the slow-burning yet eminently hooky &quot;Going Nowhere,&quot; available at Bandcamp and as a video directed by vocalist Maddy Wilde. On the track, she commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I&#39;m a self-described chump. Sometimes I&#39;ll find myself in a relationship where I&#39;m the lesser-than and the other person calls all the shots. They have the ability to improvise and lead the way with confidence while I struggle to find my own way. Most of the time this is just in my head. I tend to over analyze their accomplishments and my lack-thereof. It&#39;s a lot like Ferris Bueller&#39;s sister just watching her brother effortlessly coast through life. The more you analyze the imbalance and measure the comparisons, the more resentful you become. This is the story of one such relationship. Sometimes you gotta chill out, give in, and follow the leader just to see what happens next. Just tagging along in hopes of inheriting some of their clout and momentum along the way.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The video spins that concept into an ode to music listening behind the wheel. Wilde notes that &quot;it&#39;s a slight nod to Alannis Morissette&#39;s Ironic video, but with more cars and less knitted sweaters.&quot;</p><p>Rapport features Wilde, a current member of <a href="https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ducks Ltd.</a> and a veteran of bands like Spiral Beach and Moon King, alongside guitarist Kurt Marble and bassist Mike Pereira.

The LP finds the group working with producer Dan Boeckner (Operators, Wolf Parade) on a shrewder, darker version of their jangle-pop sound - with the band incorporating a slick layer of synths and a decidedly nocturnal lyrical outlook. You can hear that in the album&#39;s appropriately-titled first single, &quot;Night Vision,&quot; which arrives alongside a cinematic video from director Laura-Lynn Petrick.</p><p>Singer/guitarist Jeremy Gaudet commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Before &#39;Night Vision&#39; was 100% written, just the basic idea of it existing as a Kiwi Jr. song inspired us and set the tone for the record. A lot of the images in the lyrics are of teenagers driving around, trying to make plans, sharing the aux, putting their parents&#39; car in the ditch, etc. But the idea at the center of the song is that of working up the nerve to make a big decision. Like a boxer getting pumped up before a fight.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new record, the band&#39;s third, follows 2021&#39;s <em>Cooler Returns</em>. Kiwi Jr. features vocalist/guitarist Jeremy Gaudet, guitarist Brian Murphy, bassist Mike Walker, and drummer Brohan Moore. All four share keyboard credits this time out, which is strong evidence of their enthusiasm for the new sound.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIxm6xqWdcM" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=jesse_fellows><span class=artist-title><a href="https://jessefellows.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jesse Fellows</a></span><span class=media-title> &quot;Springtime Sunshine&quot; / &quot;He Speeds&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://jessefellows.bandcamp.com/album/springtime-sunshine-b-w-he-speeds" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Windsor singer-songwriter <a href="https://jessefellows.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jesse Fellows</a> recently issued &quot;Springtime Sunshine&quot; and &quot;He Speeds&quot; a crunchy pair of garage rock tunes heralding the return of good weather.

You can hear the galloping power-pop single &quot;The Acid Cowboy&quot; streaming now, alongside the decidedly twangy &quot;Life is Killing Me.&quot; The artist commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is my third album under my own name. Maybe it&#39;s a culmination of sorts. I made it with some of my best friends and they were dedicated to the songs, and it shows on the recordings. The songs are quite personal in most cases, which is why I chose to put an image of my figure on the front, which is something I was very not inclined to do. There you have it. Some older songs, some newer ones too. There&#39;s always more to a story, but it&#39;s usually better to not tell the secrets.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Sleightholm recorded at Song Has No End Studio, backed by The Beautiful Boys Band. That group featured bassist Andy Beisel, guitarists Marshall Burns and Clayton Linthicum, and drummer/pedal steel player Ian Cameron. An album release show is on the books for June 10 at Regina&#39;s T+A Vintage.</p><p>The album, arriving June 3, follows both Snake River&#39;s pandemic-delayed <em>Lost Album</em> (their sixth album) and the debut from Sleightholm&#39;s blissed-out psych-pop act, <a href="https://snakeriver.bandcamp.com/album/clouds-melt-away" class="" target=_blank>The Sunshiny Daze</a>.

That relationship took a big step forward last week with the release of <em>Enemy Us</em>, a split EP that sees the pair teaming up (and trading vocalists) to celebrate the music of San Franciscan punk band Enemy You. That group emerged in 1997, issuing material over the following decade through labels like Fat Wreck Chords, Red Scare, and Panic Button. Vocalist David Jones died of suicide in 2015.</p><p>Cluttered singer/guitarist <a href="http://mattygrace.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Matty Grace</a> commented on the groups&#39; collective affection for Enemy You&#39;s catalogue, revealing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Enemy You were a very important band to many and sometimes rad bands end up under-appreciated. This could be the case here. David Jones managed to capture heartbreak and feelings of isolation all within the confines of a 2 or 3 minute punk song and did it with wit. This split is a loving tribute to a band that although has slipped under the radar for many, still resonates strongly for us&quot;.</p></blockquote><p>The bands recorded in March and recently celebrated the release together with appearances at Pouzza Fest. The EP features a pair of tracks with Grace backed by the Talk Show Host trio (guitarist Chris Veinot, drummer Sean Woolven, and bassist Fabien Rivenet).

The label&#39;s lined up <em>Thyrsis of Etna</em> for a July 15 release, a 16-song set with each track featuring a guest vocalist or instrumental collaborator. In part, that cast includes Pylon&#39;s Vanessa Briscoe Hay, Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://markerstarling.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Marker Starling</a>, Calgary weird hero <a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chad VanGaalen</a>, <a href="https://motorists.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Motorists</a> frontman Craig Fahner, and the extended family of Canadian artists who make up the <a href="https://chandrachandra.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chandra</a> band (including post-punk icon Chandra Oppenheim herself).</p><p>You can hear several of these tracks on Bandcamp now, including the newly released single &quot;In The Dark,&quot; which pairs MISZCZYK with Stereolab&#39;s Laetitia Sadier. The hypnotically hushed tune kicks off what the press release describes as a &quot;foggy 4 am mixtape&quot; of shifting moods and sounds. The song arrived alongside a fascinating stop-motion animated video from Toronto artist <a href="http://jesseyules.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jesse Yules</a>. The director commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;For &#39;In the Dark&quot; I was inspired by 60s design icons Mary Blair and Ray Eames. Both Blair and Eames had wonderful studios full of toys, textiles and furniture, that they felt inspired joy in the viewer. I think it&#39;s every artist&#39;s dream to work out of a studio as amazing as Blair or Eames, and to create work that makes the world slightly more beautiful. The animation&#39;s narrative focuses on a designer magically manipulating the &quot;colourful junk&quot; in her office, and using the designs to transform her city. It was animated using the colourful junk in my own studio, with both stopmotion and digital techniques.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As a studio engineer, Nyles Miszcyzk&#39;s recorded several familiar faces around here, including Mark Sultan (BBQ), Century Palm, and Simply Saucer. These days he plays bass in the Chandra band while teaching sound design for George Brown College.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9B1xHfPPY4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=kamikaze_nurse><span class=artist-title><a href="https://kamikazenurse.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Kamikaze Nurse</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Pet Meds&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://kamikazenurse.bandcamp.com/track/pet-meds" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>We&#39;re hearing more and more from the upcoming <a href="http://kamikazenurse.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Kamikaze Nurse</a> record as we fast approach the June release of <em>Stimuloso</em>.

The Vancouver group&#39;s description of the track underscores the split-personality weirdness at play:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Pet Meds&#39; was inspired by a wild road trip told to John by his friend Pete. Sonya and KC interpreted the story into their own kinky road trip as &#39;Two Hot Rock Chicks Listening to Neu&#39; looking for a good mechanic, getting caught in a psychosexual transmogrification along the way.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Stimuloso</em> features ten tracks weaving elements of art-punk and shoegaze.

You can pick the three-song collection up at Bandcamp. Brown commented on the moody set:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I&#39;d had the itch to do something new in April. It was a gloomy, rainy month and I had these acoustic songs lying around. Music is kind of a funny pursuit in that I can make things on my own, but I can&#39;t make them sound as good as other people can. So if I want to do it &#39;right&#39;, it can take a long time and not every song is going to get that treatment. I get impatient. The creative impulse doesn&#39;t really care about my image.</p><p>I was home on PEI for Easter weekend and recorded the acoustic guitar/vocal tracks live off the floor in a barn on the Saturday, which was a suitably grey day. Added layers of things after the fact, mostly on the fly, which took the songs in pretty different directions. It&#39;s dark, but I think it&#39;s also fun.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Ruminations</em> follows February&#39;s &quot;All I Want&quot; single and the first volume in the Uppers&#39; <em>Official Bootleg Series</em>, a live EP that surfaced in January.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=129130325/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://sunnysideuppers.bandcamp.com/album/ruminations">Ruminations by Sunnyside Uppers</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=the_slime><span class=artist-title><a href="https://theslimehardcore.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Slime</a></span><span class=media-title> &quot;Real Garbage&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://theslimehardcore.bandcamp.com/track/real-garbage" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto punk quartet <a href="https://theslimehardcore.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Slime</a> recently shared &quot;Real Garbage,&quot; the first single from their forthcoming LP <em>Living on Borrowed Slime</em>.

Wanting to follow through on the idea embedded in the song, I sent the tracks to some immensely talented friends, artists whose unique and particular work I love uniquely and particularly: Jay Crocker of JOYFULTALK, genius, improvisor, experimental composer; Colleen Coco Collins of the defunct Construction and Destruction and newly embarked on a solo career; David Nardi, who played bass on my last couple records and is also a member of Daniel Romano&#39;s Outfit; and avant/contemporary/creative powerhouse bUDi who is a musical hero and a member of both Fiver and The Atlantic School Of Spontaneous Composition as well as the Beverly Glenn Copeland band.</p><p>I invited these artists to intervene, interfere, respond to, ignore, build on, tear open, or mend the tracks as they saw fit. The resulting works are an extension of Volcano Volcano, a collection of reconstructions, versions, and dialogues, an expression of shared possibility. They are a result of music as action in the world. We make no apology for the frenzy of our dreams.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Lambke, who first came to prominence as guitarist and co-vocalist of the beloved Guelph indie rock act <a href="http://theconstantines.wordpress.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constantines</a>, issued <em>Volcano Volcano</em> last month through <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2011103622/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://stevenlambke.bandcamp.com/album/the-frenzy-of-our-dreams-reconstructions-versions-dialogues">The Frenzy of Our Dreams - reconstructions, versions, dialogues by Steven Lambke</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=bike_thiefs><span class=artist-title><a href="https://bikethiefs.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bike Thiefs</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Small Claims Court</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/M88_hWfTjqE" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://bikethiefs.bandcamp.com/album/small-claims-court" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://bikethiefs.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bike Thiefs</a> are in Europe supporting their 2020 <a href="https://stomprecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stomp Records</a> LP <em>Leaking</em>.

The artist recently unveiled some visuals to celebrate the record&#39;s title track. The lyric video&#39;s low-budget works to its advantage, capturing a sense of high-school angst as the camera darts across marker-scrawled notebook paper. Marino commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;In Your Head&#39; is a song about &#39;that person&#39;. It could be a friend, a boyfriend, your wife, a parent, or your nagging boss! But whoever it is, they always have something to say about you or what you&#39;re doing wrong. Musically, &#39;In Your Head&#39; is fierce, noisy, chaotic, fast (both in tempo and in length), while maintaining an infectious quality that keeps it pounding &#39;in your head&#39; for days!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Marino wrote and recorded the songs that would make up <em>In Your Head</em> as the pandemic ground on, trickling out individual tracks as digital singles over the past year.

The brooding krautrock instrumental &quot;The Failure of Stiff, Tired Friends&quot; clocks in a relatively trim 6 minutes, 10 minutes shorter than the record&#39;s massive first single &quot;Feet Together, Face Up, on the Front Lawn.&quot; You can see it visualized in a new piece from animator/director Jared Karnas. He comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The mood from this piece by Yoo Doo Right brings out a feeling I&#39;m well accustomed to, which comes when we walk alone in the city, either very late at night, or very early in the morning. This moment of twilight that comes with sadness and loneliness, as we head back home after an evening that drew on. Time stops, we encounter people along the way, we hear the birds sing, yet we are lost in our thoughts, detached from our surroundings. It is this moment afloat that I set out to illustrate in this video.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The five-song, 45-minute full-length arrives June 10 through <a href="https://www.mothland.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mothland</a>. Yoo Doo Right recorded live-off-the-flor at Hotel2Tango, working with producer Radwan Ghazi Moumneh (Suuns, Ought, Fly Pan Am). The record follow&#39;s the band&#39;s 2021 debut <em>Don&#39;t Think You Can Escape Your Purpose</em>, featuring Justin Cober (guitar, synthesizers, vocals), Charles Masson (bass), and John Talbot (drums), with a guest appearance on violin from Jessica Moss.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3J6ZHal9D04" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=nutrients><span class=artist-title><a href="https://nutrientsmusic.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nutrients</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Nauseous&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/Qbx7oQSgQ4Y" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a>- Preview and purchase at <a href="https://nutrientsmusic.bandcamp.com/track/nauseous" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Laid-back jangle pop act <a href="https://nutrientsmusic.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nutrients</a> recently shared &quot;Nauseous,&quot; the second single from their upcoming album <em>Different Bridges</em>. It&#39;s one of 10 songs due for the record, arriving August 5 through Alabama&#39;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/earthlibraries/" class="" target=_blank>Earth Libraries</a>. Speaking on the new single, vocalist Taylor Teeple commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Nauseous was influenced by 90&#39;s dance-pop, which can be heard in the bass and keyboard parts, but also 80&#39;s Japanese city pop, which can be heard in the sax and guitar performances. The vocals are a blend of Taylor and Iulia&#39;s falsettos. For the singing during the main sax riff, we had an inter-band challenge of who could write the best melodic addition, and Iulia ended up winning with her lowkey but dramatic &quot;ouououous&quot;. Definitely one of our most technically demanding songs in order to play it as tight as it sounds on the album.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Nutrients debuted as Teeple&#39;s then-Montreal-based bedroom-pop project. Now operating out of Toronto, the full band features guitarist Will Hunter, drummer Turner Wigginton, bassist Sean McKee, pianist Iulia Ciobanu, and multi-instrumentalist Ben Fukuzawa. The &quot;Nauseous&quot; single also showcases <a href="https://emilysteinwall.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Emily Steinwell</a> on sax and Juan Carlos Medrano (Sultans of String) on percussion.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qbx7oQSgQ4Y" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=the_wesleys><span class=artist-title><a href="https://thewesleys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Wesleys</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Outside Voices</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://thewesleys.bandcamp.com/album/outside-voices" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Last week Montreal garage quartet <a href="https://thewesleys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Wesleys</a> issued their debut EP, <em>Outside Voices</em>.

It is the result of much trial and error, after more than 3 unsuccessful attempts to record the songs live, one magical day it all just fell into place. These songs are a perfect representation of our early style and a good example of where we are headed. 60&#39;s garage and pop style, 70&#39;s guitar riffs and 90&#39;s style, kept well alive with a DIY-spirit. Completely self-produced and self-recorded, we hope these songs bring you as much joy to listen to as they did for us to make em&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The Wesleys feature Henry Girard, William D&#39;amours, Quentin Chisholm, and Pablo Garcia-Rejon Gaubeca.

You can hear the track at Bandcamp or see it visualized with a new video from director Doni Irawan (shot in the filmmaker&#39;s home of Indonesia). The band had this to say about the piece:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We wanted the video for &#39;Don&#39;t Go Down&#39; to illustrate that the feelings which societal pressures cause (loneliness, anxiety, alienation) are universal and cross-cultural. The internal steps to overcome these problems remain the same. Regardless of what you&#39;re going through, there&#39;s always somebody else fighting a similar battle.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Junko Daydream features vocalist Jack Dove, guitarist Scott Rossignol, bassist Alex Gorton, and drummer Doug Wilding. The new track follows their fall single &quot;A House that God Built,&quot; the first reveal of their sessions with Middleton.

Simpson, a native of the UK before finding a home in Vancouver, had this to say about the record:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;There&#39;s definitely a coming of age theme on the new album. We&#39;re asking ourselves: What am I looking to get out of life, out of being in a band? What joys do I want to pursue and where do I want to place my energy moving forward?

A cathartic process to put together, our new single was born in a jam room with a narrative which came to fruition later. These lyrics channel the memory of a friend of mine who is sadly no longer with us, lost to a needless accident... Growing up, we were an inseparable pair but I was the uptight one. As such, I was constantly being told to relax and let things ride.:</p></blockquote><p>This track features Rob Helsten on vocals, guitar and synth, with drums from Steve Dumas.

You can hear the single &quot;Please Yourself&quot; now, perhaps best experienced with the surreal accompanying video (never an afterthought with the group). As with Crack Cloud&#39;s past singles, it&#39;s a multi-layered, immersive piece that somehow balances sneering aggression and a collectivist sense of hope. The band revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;As a kid, my bedroom was an altar. The images on the wall represented much of what I idolized and aspired to be. This sort of deification of pop culture helped to reinforce my sense of self narrative, however fabricated. But it also provided a sense of solidarity... with a subculture that validated insecurities in a personable way. This is what makes the media industry such a profound paradox. It is both a source of inspiration for people, as it is an engineered illusion.</p><p>Art is a mechanism for healing and discovery. You learn through it, and you grow with it. In our culture we&#39;re predisposed to quantifying art, to sanctioning it, and to manufacturing it. But underneath all of that, it is a form of living inquiry; it&#39;s how we learn to unravel the extremities in life so that we may better understand ourselves, and each other.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new record follows both <em>Pain Olympics</em> and the live LP <em>Live Leak</em>, issued later that summer.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BteWnj3vr1o" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2022-06-02-performative-hours/" rel=next title="Next article: Performative Hours"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Performative Hours</div> <div class=pagination-date>June 2, 2022</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2022-05-12-year-long-winter/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Year Long Winter"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Year Long Winter</div> <div class=pagination-date>May 12, 2022</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

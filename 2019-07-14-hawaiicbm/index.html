Picking up where their EP left off, the new material finds the band digging deep into some classic hardcore sounds, marrying the punch of the early Californian scene and some combative UK influences. The group brings together Josh Nickel of <a href="https://fashionism.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fashionism</a> (and the <a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Neon Taste</a> label) on vocals, with Joel Butler of <a href="https://nervoustalk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nervous Talk</a>/Corner Boys on guitar, Brett Thompson of <a href="https://stresseating.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stress Eating</a> on bass, and Patrick Bertrand of <a href="https://cornerboys.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Corner Boys</a> (and <a href="https://hoseheadrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hosehead Records</a>) on drums.</p><p>Chain Whip recorded this set with Braden Decorby, who previously worked on their EP. Daniel Husayn mixed and mastered the new material at the North London Bomb Factory. The record arrives on August 5.</p><p>Speaking to No Echo, the band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We wrote &#39;HawaiiCBM&#39; after the technological glitch of January 13th, 2018, when everyone on the island received cell-phone alerts that a missile attack was imminent on American soil. I kept on thinking about the ridiculous amount of influence that some people have to expose our fragility. I also kept thinking about what it must have been like to say &#39;Oh oops. Sorry. — my mistake. No missile coming.&#39;</p><p>So many people fetishize these moments. Like &#39;Bring it on!&#39; kind of stuff and I think that&#39;s such stupid posturing. Still, it&#39;s probably better to die in a nuclear holocaust than through the slow destruction of climate change I guess. Still, I&#39;d like to try and enjoy some more of my time here.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This week a handful of additional songs from <em>14 Lashes</em> are set to premiere, with one destined to surface right here at Some Party. I&#39;ll keep you posted.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=300 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/647185101&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" class=lazyload></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/josh-nickel-366733816/chain-whip-hawaiicbm" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Chain Whip - &quot;HawaiiCBM&quot; @ SoundCloud</a></p><p>Celebrated electronic duo <a href="http://atribecalledred.com/" class="" target=_blank>A Tribe Called Red</a> returned last week with a powerful new single titled &quot;The OG,&quot; which features DJs Tim &quot;2oolman&quot; Hill and Ehren &quot;Bear Witness&quot; Thomas collaborating with <a href="http://www.blackbearsingers.com/" class="" target=_blank>Black Bear</a>, a group of Pow Wow singers and drummers from Manawan, Quebec.</p><p>The song was inspired by, and features audio samples of, Cree lawmaker Romeo Saganash speaking to the House of Commons. Last September, while debating the future of the Trans Mountain Pipeline, the NDP MP, took Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to task using some infamously colourful language:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;When the prime minister says that this pipeline expansion will be done no matter what, and his minister adds that Canada will not be able to accommodate all Indigenous concerns, what that means is that they have decided to willfully violate their constitutional duties and obligations...</p><p>Mr. Speaker, sounds like a most important relationship, doesn&#39;t it? Why doesn&#39;t the prime minister just say the truth and tell Indigenous peoples that he doesn&#39;t give a fuck about their rights?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Saganash represents the Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou riding, which encompasses much of northern Quebec. In a statement Bear Witness commented on that event:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It would be impossible to overstate the impact that Romeo Saganash&#39;s words had on the Indigenous world and on us personally. We feel that the stand he took that day in parliament needs to be remembered, memorialized and commemorated. This is a celebration of that moment. Romeo, the Halluci Nation salutes you.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A Tribe Called Red last released <em>We Are The Halluci Nation</em> in 2017.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgsuWSxs1fw" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/zgsuWSxs1fw" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: A Tribe Called Red - &quot;The OG&quot; (featuring Black Bear) @ YouTube</a></p><p>Last week the enigmatic Toronto songwriter Ben Cook unveiled more music from his upcoming <a href="https://youngguv.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Young Guv</a> record, <em>GUV 1</em>.

The 8-song set, which follows up 2018&#39;s heavily stylized <em>2 Sad 2 Funk</em>, will serve as the first in a two-album series, with its counterpart due in the fall. Ben Cook&#39;s, of course, well known for his more aggressive outings, be it as the frontman of the Toronto hardcore unit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/nowarning666" class="" target=_blank>No Warning</a> or as one of the many moving parts that comprise the critically acclaimed <a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3776892109/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://youngguv.bandcamp.com/album/guv-i">GUV I by Young Guv</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://youngguv.bandcamp.com/album/guv-i" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Young Guv - &quot;Roll With Me&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Amiable Montreal pop-punks <a href="https://lostlove.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lost Love</a> have a new two-song single online via Germany&#39;s <a href="https://uncle-m.com/" class="" target=_blank>Uncle M Records</a>. The set features the tracks &quot;Glenn Spaghetti Legs&quot; and &quot;Ontarien Demandé,&quot; both of which were recorded during the sessions that resulted in last year&#39;s <em>Good Luck Rassco</em> LP. The former seems to be a reference to when Glenn Danzig was knocked out by North Side Kings singer Danny Marianinho. Remember that? The Internet most certainly does.</p><p><em>Good Luck Rassco</em> came out on May 25 via <a href="https://stomprecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stomp Records</a> and the French label <a href="http://guerilla.limitedrun.com/" class="" target=_blank>Guerilla Asso</a>. It followed up the band&#39;s 2016 album <em>Comfortable Scars</em>.

Across the fairgrounds, the event&#39;s main stage will feature the Vancouver indie rock supergroup <a href="http://www.thenewpornographers.com/" class="" target=_blank>The New Pornographers</a> headlining on Friday, with Toronto hip-hop luminary <a href="https://www.shadk.com/" class="" target=_blank>Shad</a> closing the shindig on Saturday night. The music festival&#39;s a significant charitable fundraiser in the region as well, bringing in over $711,000 since 2009 for local causes. Some Party&#39;s a co-sponsor of the Black Forest Stage this year, which is really just an excuse for me to plant myself in the nexus of awesome that forms between that stage, the half-pipe, and the bar.

The band, self-described as &quot;post-industry / loser rock,&quot; are a week away from the release of their new EP, the appropriately-titled <em>New/Shiny</em>. That record arrives on July 20 from <a href="https://www.artoftheuncarvedblock.com/" class="" target=_blank>Art of the Uncarved Block</a> on cassette.</p><p><em>New/Shiny</em> is Low Sun&#39;s follow-up to their 2017 drone-rock album <em>Reservoir of Impermanent Light</em>. While the tour supporting that record brought the band through Eastern Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong, that momentum didn&#39;t make the follow-up any easier. The group spent 8 months with a new bass player, only to lose them just before another European tour, this time supporting Czech hardcore band DNO. Out of necessity Low Sun was reborn as a duo, rewrote their EP from the ground up, and started this, their second life.</p><p>Low Sun features the brothers Peter and Robert Johnson, who together run Art of the Uncarved Block (<a href="https://mildewmildew.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mildew Mildew</a>, <a href="https://madelink.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>PAX</a>) and previously played together as Shahman. When asked about &quot;Cold Light and a Fare,&quot; the band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I don&#39;t remember much, but I remember it being the end of something. I recall the light more than anything. And the feeling. That feeling that sticks to you like the humidity that makes the walls sweat.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Low Sun will launch the tape with a pair of shows next weekend. They&#39;ll play <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/353502888697541/" class="" target=_blank>Weekend At Bernie&#39;s</a> in their hometown alongside Milwaukee&#39;s Large Print, Toronto power-pop act <a href="http://www.prettymatty.com" class="" target=_blank>Pretty Matty</a>, and Blankscreen on July 20.

It is about filling the role of taking care of someone and self-identifying through that, while simultaneously resenting the expectation of having to do so.</p><p>The chorus begins hinting at waiting for a relationship to finally feel reciprocal, and ends with the reveal of me actually waiting for it to fall apart / knowing all along that it was doomed.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The record finds Niemi and co-vocalist Nick Everett splitting songwriting duties across 11 new tracks that the four-piece recorded at <a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chad VanGaalen</a>&#39;s Yoko Eno studio.

Most of us are so busy just trying to make rent, or staring at our phones all night to realize that our lives are caught in this cycle of suck. The drive to find purpose or some sort of meaning within our current socio-economic climate is a recurring theme in our music.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The video, a <em>Fight Club</em> parody, was shot by Josh Bradford of Silverstein.

It’s a collaboration between Peter Landi and myself. I had recently moved apartments and my old landlord had sold the building we lived in and kicked everyone out. There was a real estate boom and we were all seemingly in the middle of it. Peter came to me with the song and once we were in the studio the lyrics came right away. I was just venting. A few years before I was living in my van. Sometimes it takes all the energy you have just to keep the lights on.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Through a Wall</em> was released on <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone</a> in Canada and <a href="http://www.bsmrocks.com" class="" target=_blank>Big Scary Monsters</a> overseas.

It arrives on August 23 from <a href="https://paperbagrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Paper Bag Records</a>, preceded by the new single and video for &quot;The Carrier.&quot;</p><p><em>Woe</em> has its roots in tragedy, stemming from the 2010 death of You Say Party drummer Devon Clifford, who suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage on stage in Vancouver while performing with the now-defunct group. The press-release delves into the difficult journey Ninkovic&#39;s been on since:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;From that devastating moment, Becky found herself deep in a mental health crisis triggered by trauma and grief. <em>Woe</em> is a collection of songs that share in ache and loss: loss of her band family, loss of a clear identity, loss of an old belief system, loss of her body transformed through motherhood and loss of life. The process took many years. Wordless melodies and beats gestated through time, though they were never intended for public release, the songs somehow pushed their way to the surface. Finally, Becky began to develop a sense of resiliency, hope for her artistic process — and for life itself-through therapeutic work, motherhood and the process of recording her new album.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A pair of BC shows have been confirmed in support of the album, July 25 in Abbotsford at the <a href="https://jaminjubilee.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jam In Jubilee</a> festival and August 24 in New Westminister. The performances are to feature a backing choir and multi-media elements.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jq3oIDw9b4I" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Jq3oIDw9b4I" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Becky Ninkovic - &quot;The Carrier&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto garage-rock trio <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheMooksTO" class="" target=_blank>The Mooks</a> have a new video online for &quot;Not Around,&quot; one of the six tunes from their recent EP <em>I Hope That You Feel The Same.</em> Chris Brown directed the clip for the cooly restrained, retro-minded song.</p><p>The Mooks recorded their new EP with Calvin Hartwick at Dreamhouse Studios in Toronto.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_DAWY7QM_Q" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/n_DAWY7QM_Q" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: The Mooks - &quot;Not Around&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>I&#39;ve yet to write much about raucous Ottawa punk group <a href="https://liquidassets.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Liquid Assets</a>, and outside of a two-song November demo there hasn&#39;t been much yet to share.

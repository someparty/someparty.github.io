Here I sit in a hermetic bubble made of dreams, trying desperately to avoid the Nth-wave before my flight to New Brunswick - and I find my excitement for the return of <a href="http://www.sappyfest.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sappyfest</a> coupled with pangs of regret that I can&#39;t be in Ottawa for the concurrent resurrection of <a href="https://sidebysideweekend.com/" class="" target=_blank>Side By Side Weekend</a>. It&#39;s, of course, entirely unreasonable to expect events 1,000 KM apart to worry about each other&#39;s schedules - but this newsletter&#39;s central conceit demands otherwise. So with my planned Sappy coverage on deck - let&#39;s focus this week on the capital.</p><p>I had the pleasure of attending the first edition of Side By Side in 2019 - a punk festival named in honour of its setting - with sets ping-ponging between the adjacent <a href="http://www.houseoftarg.com/" class="" target=_blank>House of TARG</a> and <a href="https://www.blacksquirrelbooks.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Black Squirrel Books</a>. That event, organized by Anthony Cardozo, helped fill the yearning void left by the legendary <a href="http://ottawaexplosion.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ottawa Explosion</a>. I can&#39;t overstate the influence OXW had on Some Party - I researched every band on those lineups - so the launch of Side By Side was a thrill. Between it and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sotofestottawa" class="" target=_blank>Sitting On The Outside</a>, the future felt bright for the Ottawa DIY universe.</p><p>...and then, well, it feels absurd even to bother recapping recent history. You were there. I was there. We all know what happened. Whatever...</p><p>While the summer of 2022 hasn&#39;t turned out to be nearly as worry-free as anyone hoped, the world&#39;s gears are defiantly turning again. <a href="https://sidebysideweekend.com/" class="" target=_blank>Side By Side Weekend</a> makes its triumphant return on July 29, 30 and 31 - with more than thirty acts convening in the nation&#39;s capital. Relocated this year to the recently renovated <a href="https://saw-centre.com/" class="" target=_blank>Club SAW</a>, the Side by Side name perhaps now refers to the indoor and outdoor stages planned for each day. The event&#39;s getting an assist from several prominent scene boosters, including Sitting On The Outside, but also a brand revival of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cinqhole" class="" target=_blank>Cinqhole</a> - a venue born from the momentum of the original event but tragically shuttered in the pandemic. They, along with notable promoters and publications like <a href="https://www.ottawashowbox.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ottawa Showbox</a>, <a href="https://www.debaser.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Debaser</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/firstcrush613" class="" target=_blank>First Crush</a> are sponsoring portions of the weekend.</p><p>As for the artists, throw a dart blindly at the lineup, and you&#39;ll hit someone I&#39;ve written glowingly about, or I should. Friday features <a href="https://demofest.bandcamp.com/album/precious-failures-demo-fest-2020" class="" target=_blank>Precious Failures</a>, <a href="https://seaoftroublesband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Sea of Troubles</a>, <a href="https://mrpower.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Mr. Power</a>, and <a href="https://winelips.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Wine Lips</a> outside, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EPi8zSBm1I" class="" target=_blank>Bitch Stick</a>, <a href="https://sleeplate.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Sleep Late</a>, <a href="https://deliverables.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Deliverables</a>, <a href="https://prettymatty.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pretty Matty</a>, and the beach punk fiends <a href="https://barnaclemtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Barnacle</a> indoors. How excited am I to learn that Barnacle survived the apocalypse?</p><p>Saturday starts with a matinee featuring <a href="https://jasminetrailsss.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Jasmine Trails</a>, Auto Sleeper, and <a href="https://piith.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pith</a>, with the evening outdoor stage touting <a href="https://backseatdragon.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Backseat Dragon</a>, <a href="https://jazzdads.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Jazz Dads</a>, <a href="https://kicksie.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Kicksie</a>, and the ethereal <a href="https://boyhoodsongs.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Boyhood</a>. Indoors look for perennial Some Party obsession Chris Page live with <a href="https://expandafuzz.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Expanda Fuzz</a>, playing alongside <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hugmosh" class="" target=_blank>Hug Mosh</a>, <a href="https://burnerband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Burner</a>, and <a href="https://rivalledenvy.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Rivalled Envy</a>.</p><p>Sunday&#39;s outdoor matinee kicks off with <a href="https://crisisparty.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Crisis Party</a> - the new side project from Cluttered&#39;s Matty Grace, Ottawa mainstay Ska Jeff (ex-Dogma), and fest organizer Tony Cardozo. They&#39;ll play alongside <a href="https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/REhx1" class="" target=_blank>Dogspear</a>, <a href="https://stoby613.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Stoby</a>, and <a href="https://joncreeden.com" class="" target=_blank>The Flying Hellfish</a>. That evening you&#39;ll find <a href="https://darttrees.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Dart Trees</a>, <a href="https://guestroomstatus.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Guest Room Status</a>, <a href="https://www.weekendgoodbye.com" class="" target=_blank>Weekend Goodbye</a> and <a href="https://fanclubwallet.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Fanclubwallet</a> outdoors. Finally, the weekend wraps inside with <a href="https://ultra-love.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ultra Love</a>, <a href="https://sonagiphl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Sonagi</a>, <a href="https://nomanband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>NØ MAN</a>, and the ever-evolving heavy Haligonians of <a href="https://botfly.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Botfly</a>.</p><p>I asked Tony how the struggles of the past few years impacted the fest, and by extension, Ottawa&#39;s underground rock scene. He didn&#39;t disappoint with his answer:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We&#39;ve all been dealing with so many degrees of hardship throughout the pandemic, and in varying levels of isolation too. It&#39;s been exhausting. Even at the best of times, it&#39;s easy to feel disconnected and alone. Local shows and small festivals have been life-changing for me in the past and they can be so important to the community. I knew I wanted to see something like this continue to exist here. We&#39;ve lost some valued gathering places for local music and art, from Pressed to Cinqhole to Babylon... they all served important functions in service of the larger cultural landscape that is still reeling and recovering. I hope this thing can play a small role in connecting and reconnecting people with their community.</p><p>I also want to acknowledge the continued COVID-related risks and anxieties that exist around attending events. It&#39;s really hard to constantly retrain ourselves for what feels safe and comfortable, and I want to acknowledge that a lot of people are in very different places with that stuff. And attending events is by no means the &#39;only way&#39; or the &#39;best way&#39; to connect with your community; you are just as much a part of things whether you&#39;re physically present or not. All this to say, it&#39;s still a weird time, we&#39;re all still tired, but we&#39;re all still hungry for community and connection so this festival is an attempt at retaining some of that. I hope that connects and resonates with people. So, if you&#39;re gonna be in town and if you&#39;re able to / comfortable with it, MASK UP AND GET TO THE FRIGGIN GIGS!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>That&#39;s not all - this weekend (Friday, July 22), there&#39;s a pre-festival event at TARG featuring Vancouver siblings <a href="https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Apollo Ghosts</a> and <a href="https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tough Age</a> - a stop on their tour eastwards to Sappy. They&#39;ll play the arcade alongside <a href="https://outtacontroller.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Outtacontroller</a> and <a href="https://heavybedroom.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Heavy Bedroom</a>.

You can see it visualized in a video filmed by Leila Meshgini and edited by the band&#39;s Dustin Bromley. It has all the attitude and charm of those classic Beastie Boys clips, with the trio mugging at the camera as they saunter through the urban landscape. Love it.</p><p>The album&#39;s due on August 16 through <a href="https://westerlyrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Westerly Records</a>, featuring eight songs tracked with Jesse Gander at Raincity Recorders.</p><p>Brutal Poodle features bassist/vocalist Karmin Poirier, guitarist/vocalist John Johnston, and drummer Dustin Bromley.

The band features Grace paired with her <a href="https://cluttered.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Cluttered</a> bandmate Becca Dalley on vocals, with the pair performing a set of five speedy songs in as many minutes. It&#39;s part of a songwriting challenge Grace undertook to write &quot;like... actual hardcore songs&quot; earlier in the year. I think she did just that!</p><p>Sewercide&#39;s soon putting the demo out on cassette, with a pre-order up at Bandcamp. Earlier this year, Grace and Dalley appeared on <em>Year Long Winter</em>, the recent EP from bummer-punk heroes <a href="https://futuregirls.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Future Girls</a>. Cluttered meanwhile issued the <em>Enemy Us</em> split back in May with Toronto&#39;s <a href="http://www.talkshowhost.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Talk Show Host</a>, celebrating the music of the defunct Californian punk group Enemy You.

The track finds the artist upping the tempo and reconnecting the minimalist energy of early punk rock. He comments:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Visions&#39; is the sound of power chords and an overactive right arm. No more intricate, overly complex guitar parts or different time signatures. It&#39;s Buzzcocks or the Dead Boys at its core, angular and jangly. Musically, it&#39;s the most direct thing I&#39;ve ever done. No hiding behind walls of reverb, mutating time signatures, or vague lyrics.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new set arrives on the heels of the full-length debut from <a href="http://saunaaa.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Sauna</a>, le Riche&#39;s synth-pop trio with ex-<a href="https://www.weavesband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Weaves</a> bassist Zach Bines and <a href="https://greys.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Greys</a> drummer Braeden Craig. That group issued <em>Dose Yourself</em> in May. This new incarnation of Fake Palms finds le Rich mainly working solo, performing the brunt of guitar, bass, and vocals, with backing from <a href="https://dillydally.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dilly Dally</a>&#39;s Benjamin Reinhartz on percussion. Evan Lewis of <a href="https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ducks Ltd.</a> fleshed out a half-dozen of the songs on guitar, with additional appearances logged from early Palms guitarist Patrick Marshall, percussionist Braeden Craig, and <a href="https://www.twistofficial.com/" class="" target=_blank>Twist</a> vocalist Laura Hermiston.

Dash progressive rock opera from the list - as September will see the arrival of <em>La Luna</em> - an LP featuring a single song comprised of 12 movements, complete with an overture and grand finale. The work finds the Welland singer/songwriter backed by his band The Outfit, with the usual ensemble augmented by Kenneth Roy Meehan, Mark Lalama, Raha Javanfar, Aaron Hutchinson, and Kristian Montano in various roles. This incarnation of The Outfit features the players currently touring behind 2021&#39;s <em>Cobra Poems</em>: vocalists Julianna Riolino and Carson McHone, bassist Roddy Rosetti, guitarist Dave Nardi, and drummer Ian Romano.</p><p>You can hear an excerpt from the new work, a segment titled &quot;Genuine Light,&quot; streaming at Bandcamp now. In a write-up the label detailed each side of the LP, in the process shedding some light on The Outfit&#39;s roles in the work:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Side 1 of La Luna is experienced as a document of first asking: musical themes are introduced, lyrics, later to be repeated, are given first voice. There is a lightness, not of illumination necessarily, but of feeling. The Outfit, the ever-masterful Outfit, giving collective voice to the poet&#39;s words. Yes, close followers of Daniel Romano&#39;s may well know his poetry oft bends to the Romantic, to the Mystical. You have read it in the collections of his poetry (Weaker Animals Too, At Last There Is No End); you have heard it sung in the psychedelic folk masterpiece Finally Free. These words gain new weight as Julianna Riolino, David Nardi, and Carson McHone weave their own voices around Daniel&#39;s, taking lead on individual verses, joining in immaculately arranged harmony. It is, in accumulation, a collective voice - a liturgy, an act of public worship. And like all worship, it is seeking an understanding of our place, of the very nature of our existence. A seeking that, despite moments of ecstatic clarity, given great musical voice throughout, ultimately discovers its own limits, discovering a place of ultimate unknowing: discovers &#39;true wisdom in seeking&quot;; discovers &#39;Memory and Fate / And all that we create / Pale against the weight/ Of the keeper&#39;</p><p>And so, with Side 2, we begin again, of course, more troubled, beginning again with all the unsolved riddles and questions of existence, down in the deep black groove. Where once the lyrics measured our closeness, now they measure our distance (&#39;Prayer is but a personal obsession&#39;). Side 2, haunted by echoes, crossed by shadows. If this is perhaps true of Side 2s everywhere, La Luna strikes me as unique in its brave acknowledgement of the facts. One must reckon with the past, the Grand Preceding; personal history of course, but also the harrowing recognition that the individual is born of collective histories.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>That sounds like some unconstrained maximalism in the spirit of Fucked Up&#39;s Zodiac series, and I&#39;m all for it. You can fully absorb <em>La Luna</em> when it arrives on September 9 through <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>.</p><p>The Outfit is currently on the road in Europe, paused but on the cusp of recovery from a COVID outbreak.

The news came alongside the heavy and forbidding new single &quot;Have You Seen Her.&quot; The song, and in particular the accompanying video, furthers the band&#39;s fascination with Italian folklore, mining their grandmother&#39;s stories for haunting source material. They comment:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The music video plays out like a sci-fi involving an alternate dimension/timeline. Using the same idea of the malocchio that haunted our nonna decades ago, what does it look like when conjured by generations later in the future, and can this generational haunting finish once and for all? We see two siblings confront the malocchio head-on, only for it to follow once more. The curse has become a part of them. Do not be afraid.</p><p>Have You Seen Her is also about the tragic loss of a loved one, longing to be with them, and wondering where they&#39;ve ended up - above the clouds? Below the earth? A new (to us) dimension? Death is the only thing we know to be true in this world. Precious memories here are what we hold onto. When our loves are taken from us by what may be a curse, it&#39;s only natural that we want to find a way to reverse it, and reunite with them in harmony.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Bonnie Trash is a project of twin sisters Emmalia and Sarafina Bortolon-Vettor. Emmalia plays guitar on the track, with Sarafina on drums and vocals. The group recorded with the aforementioned Josh Korody co-producing at Candle Recording Studio in Toronto. The new set follows the band&#39;s 2017 <em>Ezzelini&#39;s Dead</em> EP and a few subsequent digital singles issued in 2019.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSKf-8aXNoM" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=trenchraid><span class=artist-title><a href="https://trenchraid.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Trenchraid</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Demo 2022</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://slow-death-records.bandcamp.com/album/trenchraid-demo-2022" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Sechelt d-beat hardcore act <a href="https://trenchraid.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Trenchraid</a> has a new four-song demo in the wild.

I walk past these &#39;Sold&#39; signs plowed into meticulously mowed lawns all over and I wonder, &#39;if there&#39;s enough hope for you in this city, will there be enough for me?&#39; And if I&#39;m being honest, I don&#39;t really want to know.

I don&#39;t know if there are many other bands you can name that are still making records with their original line up 30 years in. Look it up!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>That lineup, of course, features Pentland and Murphy alongside drummer/vocalist Andrew Scott and guitarist/vocalist Jay Ferguson. The new record follows up their 2018 LP <em>12</em> and the two recent <em>B Sides Win</em> collections issued through the group&#39;s Murderecords.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qV5wl2p04k" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2022-07-23-guide-to-sappyfest-17/" rel=next title="Next article: Some Party&#x27;s Sappyfest 17 primer"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Some Party's Sappyfest 17 primer</div> <div class=pagination-date>July 23, 2022</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2022-07-11-limit-and-a-situation/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Limit and a Situation"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Limit and a Situation</div> <div class=pagination-date>July 11, 2022</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

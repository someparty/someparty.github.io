The tune, titled &quot;Sunday Morning 2,&quot; comes with a video animated (by hand) in Jacobs&#39; instantly recognizable cartoon style. <em>Easy</em> is due on October 19 through the UK label <a href="https://stolenbodyrecords.co.uk/" class="" target=_blank>Stolen Body Records</a>. I previously shared a teaser for this record back in <a href="https://www.someparty.ca/2018-07-29-raise-your-voice-joyce/" class="" target=_blank>July</a>.</p><p>Jacobs, originally from Windsor, made his name as a one-man-band and has proved to be wildly prolific, often releasing several EPs and full-lengths within a single year. His last record, and his first vinyl release with Stolen Body, was 2016&#39;s <em>Pictures, Movies &amp; Apartments</em>. It was followed up earlier this year by the five-song EP <em>Story About Anything</em> along with a handful of lo-fi experiments shared under the name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L-7MlQZf9I" class="" target=_blank>Garbage Truck</a>.</p><p>I realize that I share Paul&#39;s stuff quite regularly on this newsletter, and I make no apologies for that.

She shared the song &quot;Surveillance&quot; in a premiere at <a href="https://www.popmatters.com/petra-glynt-surveillance-premiere-2598421385.html" class="" target=_blank>Pop Matters</a> this week, a tune that brings the industrial influence in her percussive electropop to the fore. Thematically the track tackles the loss of privacy and general lack of control we face in the corporate-driven social media era. She told Pop Matters:</p><blockquote><p> &quot;the darkness and heaviness of this song was a surprise to me as it&#39;s the only one of its kind on the album. I wrote it in reaction to the Facebook data scandals and general contempt for how impersonal our personal information has become online. We are actively using these tools, and our data is being funneled into the hands of those who can analyze it and use it to their advantage, against us, and ultimately to make more money. The song is a bit tongue and cheek and big and scary for a reason. Speaking directly to those powers it&#39;s saying &#39;yea, so what you got all this information on me, I know everything about you too&#39; because their intentions are so simplistic: more money. In this way I want them to feel small because we&#39;re out here living exciting, colorful lives despite them.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>My Flag Is A Burning Rag Of Love</em> arrives on September 7. The record, Glynt&#39;s sophomore solo effort, features 13 songs written, performed, and self-produced by Glynt. Alice Wilder (M.I.A., Austra) mixed the new tunes. The album follows up Glynt&#39;s 2017 <a href="https://www.vibeovermethod.com/" class="" target=_blank>Vibe Over Method</a> released debut, <em>This Trip</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=166 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/447510777&amp;color=%2300aabb&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" class=lazyload></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/pleasence-records/1-surveillance" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Petra Glynt - &quot;Surveillance&quot; @ SoundCloud</a></p><p>Victoria label <a href="http://www.supremeecho.com/" class="" target=_blank>Supreme Echo</a> has announced the November release of <em>East End Rockers</em>, a collection of material from the first-wave St. John’s, Newfoundland punk band <a href="http://citizenfreak.com/artists/101759-reaction-the" class="" target=_blank>The Reaction</a>.</p><p>Bassist/vocalist Mike Fisher, guitarist Rick Harbin, and drummer Terry Carter formed The Reaction in late 1978 (Carter, who went by Pasquale Neutron, was also a member of early NFLD punk group <a href="http://www.abandonstream.net/slyme/" class="" target=_blank>Da Slyme</a>). They spent much of 1979 playing shows around the Rock, and in this period produced the single &quot;On The Beach&quot; b/w &quot;The Kid&#39;s Arrived.&quot; While the studio material earned the band some local FM airplay, they called it quits in October of that year, only to reform a month later with drummer Dan Ralph. This version of the band relocated to Toronto by 1980, returning to the studio that that year. In 81 the group returned to Newfoundland and expanded their lineup to include keyboardist Stephen Jackson, but played their final show in June of that year.</p><p>The Supreme Echo reissue features a remastering of the band&#39;s recorded material from 1979 through 1981, including songs recorded with each lineup. The set will be accompanied by a booklet featuring flyers, photos, and more. The reissue will be limited to just 500 copies.

Speaking to the long-running punk website, Mike Fisher commented on the track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Get The Rods Out” has had many interpretations over the years but basically is a party song and the ‘rods’ refer to the lighting grid holding up the back drop a gigs. We used to use tent poles to hang our black backdrop in the late 70’s/80s and someone said ‘get the rod’s out’ (from the van).&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6_y19jCr88" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="http://www.50thirdand3rd.com/preview-the-reaction-get-the-rods-out-early-wave-newfoundland-punk/" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: The Reaction - &quot;Get The Rods Out&quot; @ 50thirdand3rd</a></p><p>As <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a>&#39;s power-pop/punk rock side-project <a href="http://ancientshapes.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Ancient Shapes</a> wrapped up a week of triumphant shows across Ontario, his label announced a vinyl release of the band&#39;s sophomore album <em>Silent Rave</em>.

Romano described the song in their write-up as:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The world itself revolting against the heinous behaviours of its &#39;smartest&#39; inhabitants. The feeling that, whether we find ourselves fighting it, ignoring it, or denying it, it is in fact there, just on the other side of a giant comma.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The video was shot, edited, and directed entirely by the Romano.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wx5yPM8MoBY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/wx5yPM8MoBY" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Ancient Shapes - &quot;Giant Comma&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Sudbury&#39;s <a href="https://tommyandthecommies.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Tommy and the Commies</a> formerly launched their debut album with a show at the recently concluded <a href="https://uphere.com/" class="" target=_blank>Up Here</a> festival.

It features eight tracks of protest music from female artists playing in a range of styles, from early anarcho-punk to UK82 and goth. Why am I mentioning it here? Well, you&#39;ll recall that &quot;Raise Your Voice Joyce&quot; was the first single from <a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a>&#39;s upcoming full-length <em>Dose Your Dreams</em>, and this appears to be an officially sanctioned companion piece.</p><p>The band&#39;s being (typically) oblique about the whole thing.

Nor should you assume that this is akin to <em>David&#39;s Town</em>, the companion record to 2011&#39;s <em>David Comes To Life</em> — most notably because that comp featured entirely fictional bands and the groups featured here (Arms Race, Nekra, Sauna Youth, Hurula) are all quite real.</p><p>While the full extent of this thing remains to be revealed, you can now check out the song &quot;Black Cardigans&quot; by Bryony Beynon below.

With that in mind, check out the band&#39;s 2017 full-length <em>Bricolage</em>, a propulsive 10-song riot of a record that&#39;ll have you shouting along like it&#39;s 1995. The band released the album on December 31 of last year, with a cassette release on Too Many Notes and an import CD from Japan&#39;s Urban Sleep Discs. This is the kind of music I spent most of my teenage years chasing, so it brings a smile to my face to hear it done so well.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1839920078/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://mentalfix.bandcamp.com/album/bricolage">Bricolage by Mental Fix</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://mentalfix.bandcamp.com/album/bricolage" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Mental Fix - <em>Bricolage</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Oh, and this is an unsolicited endorsement, but if in the waning days of the summer you happen to find yourself at a cottage on Lake Erie and need a quality beach beer, you could do a hell of a lot worse than Beau&#39;s <a href="https://beaus.ca/beer/buenos-dias/" class="" target=_blank>Buenos Dias</a> citrus gruit.

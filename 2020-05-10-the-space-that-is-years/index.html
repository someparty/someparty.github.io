Wilson unfairly diminished the 12-song <em>Power and Prowess</em> as a rip-off of Olympia&#39;s legendary Beat Happening (&quot;but [with] some punky songs, because punk is the best&quot;), but you should judge for yourself over at Bandcamp. The home-recorded project features the couple with guest appearances by <a href="http://camfraser.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Cam Fraser</a> of <a href="https://hugeluge.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Luge</a>, Mary Getachew of <a href="https://www.sexeducationbytheatre.com/" class="" target=_blank>SExT</a>, Kenny Boothby of <a href="https://littlekid.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Little Kid</a>, and Nathan Patrick of <a href="https://albertplague.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Albert Plague</a>. Wilson tries on a few different vocal modes as the record progresses, with the quirky pop backing giving her a little more space to play she had among WLMRT&#39;s breakneck frenzy.</p><p>WLMRT last released the 10-song full-length cassette <em>Forever</em> in 2019, with Pitman producing. It followed the band&#39;s 2018 <a href="http://www.pleasencerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pleasence Records</a> EP <em>Lube 2</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1797812726/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://onlygodforgivesto.bandcamp.com/album/power-and-prowess">Power and Prowess by Only God Forgives</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://onlygodforgivesto.bandcamp.com/album/power-and-prowess" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Only God Forgives - <em>Power and Prowess</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p><a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a>&#39;s enviably prolific quarantine hasn&#39;t gone unnoticed in the world outside this newsletter, but last week the Welland artist unveiled what may be his most over-the-top release of the period. Along with his remote-recording band The Outfit, and inexplicably joined by Tool drummer Danny Carey, he shared a nearly 23-minute prog epic dubbed &quot;Forever Love&#39;s Fool.&quot; You can find the opulent new track now on Bandcamp.</p><p>This particular genre swerve follows the country-styled record <em>Content To Point The Way</em>, the slightly more alt-country LP <em>&quot;Visions Of The Higher Dream&quot;</em>, and the punky EP <em>Super Pollen</em> (with Jonah Falco and Mike Haliechuk <a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a>).

The band&#39;s nimble &#39;quarantine-core&#39; has the added wrinkle of constraining each song to no more than 12 words. That restriction gives the whole set a wonderfully minimalist feel, perfect for tuning out the crushing complexities looming just ahead of us. In that way it&#39;s very pure and Ramones-like. These recordings feature Grace on all instruments and vocals, with mixing and mastering provided by Will Killingsworth.</p><p>In normal times Grace fronts of <a href="https://futuregirls.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Future Girls</a> and recently released a pair of solo recordings. March saw the arrival of <em>Rumination Year</em>, a six-song folk-punk set that&#39;s been in the works for several years under the studio eye of that <a href="https://surrendersounds.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Surrender</a>&#39;s Dave Williams. It arrived just a few weeks after <em>Beneath The Bridges</em>, a four-song split cassette pairing Grace and the Dartmouth rock trio <a href="https://designosaur.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Designosaur</a>.</p><p>Matty Grace is a veteran of several Halifax-based punk and hardcore groups, a list that includes the <a href="https://fatstupids.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fat Stupids</a>, <a href="https://weekenddads.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Weekend Dads</a>, <a href="https://outtacontroller.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Outtacontroller</a>, and <a href="https://cutie902.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Cutie</a> among others. Future Girls last released the full-length <em>Motivation Problems</em> in 2018. Cutie has a song on <em>Seaside Sickness</em>, the upcoming compilation of east coast punk and hardcore from <a href="http://sewerciderecords.limitedrun.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sewercide Records</a>.

I&#39;m having a hard time keeping track anymore).</p><p>PRIORS last released <em>New Pleasure</em>, their sophomore full-length in 2018 alongside the quick follow-up EP titled <em>Call For You</em>. Both arrived on <a href="https://www.slovenly.com/" class="" target=_blank>Slovenly Records</a>.

The project&#39;s kept out of public view following the Pleasence release of the <em>Unnatural Habits</em> EP, in part due to a sudden bout of sensorineural hearing loss that struck Payne late last year. While not related to playing music, the condition&#39;s left the artist all but deaf in his left ear. While that uncertainty persists, it was nice to hear Payne return this week with a pair of new video singles. You can premiere &quot;Self Control&quot; and &quot;Walking Around&quot; on YouTube now.</p><p>&quot;Waling Around&quot; was filmed on the west side of Toronto, including footage shot at the Studio Z recording space and Stanislav Jurkovic&#39;s <a href="https://www.blueroom-on-college.com/" class="" target=_blank>Blue Room</a> public art project. Sara May directed, filmed, and edited the clip. Payne commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#39;s a synth pop tune full of mixed emotions, featuring Kristina Smiff&#39;s vocal debut (the angelic backups). The song itself is about being stuck inside during the winter and itching to go out and explore. It wasn&#39;t written with a pandemic in mind but it still works with the current mood out there. If you do go outside, be safe.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Self Control&quot; meanwhile features video synthesizer effects by Travis Kiid. Both tracks were produced and mixed by Adrian Popovich (Solids, PRIORS) and mastered by Mikey Young.</p><p>Andrew Payne formerly played in the new wave-inspired Toronto indie rock outfit <a href="https://centurypalm.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Century Palm</a>. Before that, he served time in an array of weirdo garage-punk units like <a href="https://zebrassieres.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Zebrassieres</a>, the <a href="https://ketamines.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ketamines</a>, and the Fun Funs.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tS6y5fNZUDg" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/tS6y5fNZUDg" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Vanity Phase - &quot;Self Control&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3BuXNJPRUk" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/a3BuXNJPRUk" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Vanity Phase - &quot;Walking Around&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p><a href="https://schemepunk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Scheme</a> is a tough-as-nails Vancouver D-beat hardcore group with members hailing from the Halifax crust band <a href="https://napalmraid.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Napalm Raid</a>, along with the BC punks acts <a href="https://massgravecrust.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mass Grave</a>, <a href="https://phanepunx.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Phane</a>, and Decontrol. The pandemic not only took down the group&#39;s near-term touring plans, but it also nixed their first planned live performance at all. While holding out hope that they&#39;ll hit stages in the UK this fall, the band&#39;s proceeding with the release of their 10-song self-titled debut here at home. You can pick it up now as a limited cassette release from Kamloops&#39; <a href="http://slow-death-records.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Slow Death Records</a>.</p><p>Josh at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Neonwastewebzine/" class="" target=_blank>Neon Waste</a> recently featured the group on his webzine, commenting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Scheme adopts that classic Swedish hardcore in the riffs and drumming. Barking over the top is a great, dry vocal delivery that is really refreshing to hear with this style. Without trying to sound too typical, I&#39;m hearing some Troops of Tomorrow meets Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing against a backdrop of choose-your-own-adventure D-Takt. If you&#39;re a fan of this stuff like I am it&#39;s at least worthy of some time and if you&#39;re only on the periphery of that stuff then I&#39;d still recommend it.

The liner notes at Bandcamp pile on the sun-baked 70s psychedelia:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;...Barely using words to communicate, their instruments became highly charged positive ion conductors for a natural telepathy between these two local burnouts. On board was Tony Price, manning the controls, with the results, of what you have here, their FRIED AS THE SKY debut LP. Its overcooked and burnt to the CORE, but once cooled, these jams come LEAKING out of your mind hole like an unholy baptism of PEACE. Rough and frayed like yr mind, but comforting like yr old Uncle Billy&#39;s drug rug. Ask the peyote coyote, he&#39;ll tell you its no easy ride, but enlightenment never is. So take it EZ or just TAKE IT.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Co-producer Tony Price, who plays in the Young Guv touring band, was behind the boards on recent releases from Ice Cream and US Girls. The self-titled Stonegrass LP clocks in with seven songs and is due in full on May 22. The duo recorded this material over two separate days in back in 2018.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2775095283/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://cosmicrangerecords.bandcamp.com/album/stonegrass">STONEGRASS by Stonegrass</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://cosmicrangerecords.bandcamp.com/album/stonegrass" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Stonegrass - <em>Stonegrass</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>While quarantined in PEI, Mathias Kom of <a href="http://www.wearetheburninghell.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Burning Hell</a> recorded &quot;I Want to Drink in a Bar,&quot; a track that longs for the day when one could do such things without risking a calamity. That song now has an accompanying video, with Kom performing solo on an old Hammond organ in an appropriately claustrophobic plastic-wrapped bubble. You can find it on YouTube now. The band plans to make the song available for purchase again on Bandcamp when the service next waives its revenue share (June 5 and July 3 are up next), with all money raised to be due for COVID-19 shuttered venues.</p><p>The band&#39;s also taking part in the efforts of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PEIMusiciansForMigrantWorkerRelief/posts/119454176403785/" class="" target=_blank>PEI Musicians for Migrant Worker Relief</a>, a group focused helping the migrant farmworkers who&#39;ve been thus far ineligible for emergency support from the Canadian government. To that end, they&#39;ve made their four-track EP <em>Birdwatching on Garbage Island</em> available once again as a limited-time download. The set was initially released as a lathe-cut 10&quot; last spring and has been unavailable since selling out then. The EP won&#39;t be available for long either, as some of these tracks will likely be re-worked for the band&#39;s future follow-up to 2017&#39;s <em>Revival Beach</em>.</p><p>Ariel and Mathias, under their given names and not billed as &quot;The Burning Hell,&quot; recently released <em>Never Work</em> on <a href="https://bbislandmusic.com/shop/burning-hell-ariel-sharratt-mathias-kom-never-work-vinyl-cd" class="" target=_blank>BB*Island</a>.

Guitarist/vocalist Adam Sturgeon commented on the track in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Nshwaaswi is the name of the eighth song on our record Warrior Down. Much of Anishinaabe culture is based around the number seven, most notably our 7 Grandfather Teachings (Truth, Love, Bravery, Respect, Humility, Honesty and Wisdom) and the stages of life. We also have a prophecy that talks about an 8th fire or stage that we as humans can choose to light. The 8th fire of prosperity, love and well-being. An eternal fire of peace.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Videographer Travis Welowszky directed the &quot;Nshwaaswi&quot; clip, piecing together a surprisingly nerve-wracking, if downright apocalyptic, narrative from Sturgeon&#39;s old family vacation footage. <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> released <em>Warrior Down</em> last November.

The pop-rock band was supporting that set, another Dine Alone release, on tour with Toronto punks PUP when COVID-19 hit. The &quot;Break&quot; video compiles live footage from that abbreviated trek.</p><p>A <a href="http://floodmagazine.com/77651/premiere-the-drew-thomson-foundation-reminisce-on-tour-life-in-break-video/" class="" target=_blank>Flood Magazine</a> feature premiering the video also includes a conversation between Thomson and PUP frontman Stefan Babcock that recounts the final days of that tour. In the piece Thomson also comments on the sentiment behind &quot;Break,&quot; calling to mind the mental gulf between the first and second semesters of university:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;There was a Greyhound station around the corner from my apartment in London, ON that would fill up with university and college students every weekend during the school year. These kids would be heading back to Toronto or the surrounding area to their parents&#39; house or wherever and I would pass them by very often. In the crowds there would be new couples saying goodbye for the first time. Do you remember love in the time of first year? Lunch dates at the student union building? Was everything so new and important?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can follow that Drew&#39;s train of thought in the Flood article. It certainly seems to line up with my own experience as a freshman.</p><p>Last month Thomson did his part in adding to the collective flood of archival material hitting Bandcamp, releasing a massive 37-song trove of demos and outtakes titled <em>Bedroom Door</em>. It appeared during one of the site&#39;s artist-benefitting Friday events in which the company waived its revenue share.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xhBRXCGrmjk" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/xhBRXCGrmjk" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: The Drew Thomson Foundation - &quot;Break&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>The third portion of new media to arrive last week from Thomson&#39;s camp was a spoken-word solo project dubbed <a href="http://drewthomson.bandcamp.com/album/no-idea-head" class="" target=_blank>No Idea Head</a>.

Today that list included Sackville, New Brunswick&#39;s <a href="http://www.sappyfest.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sappyfest</a>, a gathering and a state of mind that&#39;s played a pivotal role in shaping the heart and soul of this very newsletter. The event was slated for the first weekend in August. A statement from organizers read:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;For 14 consecutive years, Sappyfest has been held, here in the heart of the heart of the heart of the maritimes, in the hot heart of summer, on the August long weekend in beautiful Sackville NB. It is with a certain sorrow that we have to acknowledge that even impossible dreams sometimes meet impossible realities. The ongoing public health situation will prevent us from hosting Sappyfest, as we&#39;ve come to know it and love it, this summer.</p><p>So many of you have gathered here, from near and far, year after year, and given your kindness and your generosity and your genius to make Sappyfest what it is. Please know we miss you dearly and true, and look forward to a time when circumstances may be more lenient and allow us to welcome each other, face to face.</p><p>For those of you who trusted us enough to purchase an early-bird ticket for this year, we thank you, foreverly, and will be in touch to work out the details of your refund.</p><p>While we cannot meet this year in person under Sackville&#39;s magic summer sky, all is not lost. The Sappyfest spirit remains strong. Swamp magic still rises unexpectedly, and our dreams and goals remain the same: to foster connections, collaborations, and encounters; to celebrate and present great art and music; to work together to make something surprising and kind and hope filled.</p><p>Sappyfest will manifest this summer, at more or less the appointed time, in a new way. More on this soon. With love, sappiness, and good dreams, Team Sappy&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1763392870/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=4223736635/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://teenanger.bandcamp.com/album/teenager-2">Teenager by TEENANGER</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://teenanger.bandcamp.com/track/forgot-fun-2" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Teenanger - &quot;Fun Forgot&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2020-05-17-ouster-stew/" rel=next title="Next article: Ouster Stew"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Ouster Stew</div> <div class=pagination-date>May 17, 2020</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2020-05-03-ploce/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Ploce"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Ploce</div> <div class=pagination-date>May 3, 2020</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

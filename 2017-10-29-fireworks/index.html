These connections centred around Keeler&#39;s association with Gavin McInnes, the controversial co-founder of Vice (he left the organization in 2008) and a Rebel Media personality who founded the Proud Boys group. Vice released Death From Above&#39;s first record and championed the band early in their career. I&#39;ll not iterate through the evidence presented against Keeler here, as you can find recaps at the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/blog/i-am-not-alt-right-death-from-above-1979-s-jesse-keeler-responds-to-allegations-of-white-supremacist-ties-1.4375806" class="" target=_blank>CBC</a>, the <a href="https://www.avclub.com/death-from-above-bassist-jesse-keeler-denies-ties-to-fa-1819912990" class="" target=_blank>AV Club</a>, and a hundred other places at this point.</p><p>Outrage and denunciations boiled on social media for a few days, with Keeler eventually posting a statement via the band&#39;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DeathFromAbove1979/posts/1597541903618265" class="" target=_blank>Facebook page</a> to put out the fire. In it, he emphatically states that he&#39;s not a white supremacist, and attempts to contextualize his interactions with McInnes (chalking up some of it to a &quot;morbid curiosity&quot;). The statement (which you should go read in full) was seemingly enough for the author of the original exposé to go back and revise his introduction, stating:</p><blockquote><p>It’s an earnest and humble statement and I believe him. Kudos on responding in a timely manner. When the leader of The Proud Boys claim you as one of their own, you probably should denounce that shit. I, as the author of this piece, do not think Jesse Keeler is a Proud Boy or alt-right. He just seems like a giant dummy that hung out with some sketchy people and definitely said some sketchy shit on Gavin’s podcast</p></blockquote><p>Whether that&#39;ll be enough to salvage the two-piece Toronto rock band&#39;s reputation among their fanbase remains to be seen. I&#39;m not yet sure what I believe. I&#39;d prefer to take people at their word, and I don&#39;t personally know the people involved, but in abstract the &quot;morbid curiosity&quot; defence is always going to feel a little thin.</p><p>That wasn&#39;t the only bit of ugliness in the Canadian music news this week. On Friday the <a href="https://www.halifaxpopexplosion.com/" class="" target=_blank>Halifax Pop Explosion</a> had to issue an apology for the actions of a volunteer, who interrupted a performance from <a href="https://polarismusicprize.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Polaris Music Prize</a> winner <a href="https://lidopimienta.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lido Pimienta</a> with what the festival has labelled overt racism.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/halifaxpopexplosion/posts/10155752239130645" class="" target=_blank>statement</a> from Georgie Dudka, on behalf of the event&#39;s board of directors, said, in part:</p><blockquote><p>On Thursday, October 19 at the Marquee Club, a white HPX volunteer along with several other white people in the audience reacted to Lido Pimienta inviting “brown girls to the front” of the venue with overt racism. This volunteer was removed by Lido herself. They have since received notification from the festival that they are no longer welcome to volunteer with us.</p><p>We will not accept this behaviour and neither should you. Be responsible for your friends - talk to them and support them as they move towards unpacking their racism. People of Colour deserve safe spaces and it is your responsibility to help. It is also ours.</p></blockquote><p>It should be noted that Lido&#39;s made the same invitation, which is a callback to the riot grrrl movement, at other performances without incident. Steven Lambke, the creative director of <a href="http://www.sappyfest.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sappyfest</a>, posted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stevenlambke/posts/10210064695320299?pnref=story" class="" target=_blank>message</a> in support of Pimienta and reflected on the respect shown at the Sackville event.</p><h2 class=generic>On a positive note</span></h2><p>Speaking of...</p><p>It&#39;s been a couple years since <a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a>&#39;s last full length. In October of 2015 the artist released <em>Days of Heaven</em>, his first major work under his own name. He&#39;d performed and recorded for years prior as Baby Eagle and of course as a member of the beloved Guelph-bred rock band the <a href="http://theconstantines.wordpress.com/" class="" target=_blank>Constantines</a>. Of course the singer-songwriter&#39;s kept busy in the meantime, both as a co-owner of <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> and the creative director of <a href="http://www.sappyfest.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sappyfest</a>, but it&#39;s always nice to hear something new. Here it is.</p><p>&quot;Fireworks&quot; showed up online last week. The track was recorded in Toronto in August of 2016, but that fact and the lyrics are all Steven&#39;s revealed about it so far. It&#39;s a shade more uptempo than the understated love songs that comprised <em>Days of Heaven</em>. We&#39;ll just have it wait and see if it&#39;s destined for the follow up.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=166 scrolling=no frameborder=no data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/347548594&amp;color=%2300aabb&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" class=lazyload></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/steven-lambke/fireworks" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Steven Lambke - &quot;Fireworks&quot; @ SoundCloud</a></p><p>Steven&#39;s over in Europe <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sedatebookings/photos/a.231526063534212.58656.229711280382357/1627381840615287/?type=3&amp;theater" class="" target=_blank>touring</a> as support for <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a>&#39;s Jazz Police through November.

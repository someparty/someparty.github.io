Titled <em>Mushroom Death Sex Bummer Party</em> (aren&#39;t they all), the 11-song set lands October 29 through the long-running Montreal label. You can preview the record now through the single &quot;Eyes,&quot; available in a new video from director Sammy J. Lewis. Vocalist/guitarist Cam Hilborn described the clip in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Sammy had the idea of making it look like the band was playing inside a garbage bag, so we did a classic performance video but tried to make it a little more interesting with crazy fast paced cuts and some added green screen fun. It was super fun, super sweaty and we felt like trash by the end of the day.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As for the song itself, Hilborn revealed:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Eyes is a song about feeling burnt out creatively, mentally and physically. Something so many of us can relate to, even more so over the past year and a half. It sheds light on situations where you find yourself powering through the days with different coping methods brought on by late nights, alcohol and promiscuity, and seeing how far you can push the limits of your body before you find yourself defeated and broken down.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Wine Lips features vocalist/guitarist Cam Hilborn, drummer Aurora Evans, guitarist Jordan Sosensky, and bassist Charlie Weare. The group recorded at London&#39;s Sugar Shack studio with Simon Larochette producing. The new LP follows up 2019&#39;s <em>Stressor</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioJsYEN17e8" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=tunic><span class=artist-title><a href="http://tunicband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tunic</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Apprehension&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/pt0XCqvMj9Q" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://tunicband.bandcamp.com/track/apprehension" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Winnipeg noise-punks <a href="http://tunicband.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tunic</a> continue to roll out previews of <em>Quitter</em>, their upcoming LP.

The track comes accompanied by an animated video from director <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lv.rmn/" class="" target=_blank>Dimitris Armenakis</a> featuring art from Sam Neal. In a statement, guitarist/vocalist David Schellenberg revealed &quot;[the song&#39;s] about giving up, being defeated and getting bulldozed by a relationship.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Apprehension&quot; arrives as our third advance listen to the 11-song LP, due October 15 through <a href="http://artoffact.com/" class="" target=_blank>Artoffact Records</a>. The Besnard Lakes&#39; Jace Lasek (Godspeed You! Black Emperor) recorded and mixed, with Carl Saff (Mitski, Guided By Voices, Speedy Ortiz) mastering. This new material follows April&#39;s <em>Exhaling</em> collection, a 23 song set that included the entirety of Tunic&#39;s 2019 LP <em>Complexion</em> in its runtime.</p><p>While not yet naming them, Schellenberg also recently revealed the group has a new bassist selected to replace the recently departed Roy Ellis.

The song notably features backing vocals from New Zealand indie-pop group The Beths. In a statement, Ducks&#39; vocalist/guitarist Tom McGreevy shared:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Under The Rolling Moon&#39; is about trying to be there for a friend who is in a moment of crisis... Some of the frustration maybe of witnessing someone else&#39;s extremely recognizable self-defeating behaviour, but mostly just the feeling of caring for them, knowing they can be ok and hoping that they can find their way to seeing that.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The track arrived alongside a video from directors Ambar Navarro and Max Flick. The filmmakers commented on the visual lineage of their creation:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;[the band] was kinda aiming to make something that feels like a low to mid budget video in 1985, loosely inspired by some of the Cure videos and the video for Grant McLennan&#39;s &#39;Easy Come Easy Go.&#39; I feel like there is something about the awkwardness of early music videos, before people really knew what they were supposed to be or how they were supposed to act in them, that neatly dovetails with our own inherent awkwardness.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Ducks Ltd. records as a duo featuring Tom McGreevy (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) and Evan Lewis (guitar, bass, drum programming). The new record, their first LP, arrives on October 1 through <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain</a> and <a href="http://carparkrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Carpark</a>. It lands as the follow-up to their recently reissued and expanded <em>Get Bleak</em> EP.

Singer/songwriter Brandon Williams commented on the emo-flavoured track in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Pummeling&#39; was a place I was afraid to go, I&#39;ve been so focused on my music being challenging, technical, and correct.

In a statement, the band&#39;s Melanie St-Pierre spoke about the mysterious neighbour who inspired the album-opening &quot;Tommy&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Tommy is about a neighbour that Neil and I had when we lived on Caledonia St. in Toronto... He was an older British man and we would exchange pleasantries sometimes, but I never learned his real name</p><p>Items started mysteriously appearing in the bus shelter in front of his house. Thoughtful, curious, or useful things seemed to be planted there to bring people joy. It began happening more frequently and eventually I saw him placing something in there. I had this odd connection to him like I might be one of the only people who knew it was him doing this, which inspired me to write a song about him. Knowing next to nothing about him, I decided to make up an entire life story. Maybe he immigrated to Toronto a long time ago and perhaps met his wife here and had kids? Perhaps she passed away not long ago due to an illness? Who knows. The song is driven by mystery. The same sort of mystery he gave me.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new record finds Casper Skulls rebuilding around St-Pierre as their sole lead vocalist, in the process trading some of their heavier aspects for a more folk-based sound. The group now consists of Melanie backed by guitarist Neil Bednis, bassist Fraser McClean, and new. drummer Aurora Bangarth. <em>Knows No Kindness</em> arrives November 12 from <a href="https://www.nextdoorrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Next Door Records</a>, following up 2018&#39;s <em>Mercy Works</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYSqFhq8000" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=dooms_children><span class=artist-title><a href="https://doomschildren.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dooms Children</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Heavy Year&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://doomschildren.bandcamp.com/track/heavy-year" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://www.theonlybandever.com/" class="" target=_blank>Alexisonfire</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.wademacneil.com/" class="" target=_blank>Wade MacNeil</a> has another preview of his psych-rock act <a href="https://doomschildren.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dooms Children</a> online.

The Guelph-based singer-songwriter commented on this latest set, which bridges subject matter that&#39;s both nostalgic and political:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;With the release of my third EP in a series of quarantine-recorded punk songs fuelled by pandemic boredom, Part-time Cool is the not-so-secret side project that came to be realized in the first round of quarantine. There was endless amounts of time to reminisce, reflect, and be frustrated. As a result, these songs are pumped full of nostalgia and adolescent irritants that have resonated into the present.</p><p>This EP is a capsule of a quarantine state of mind. When you&#39;re missing your friends, live music, and whatever we mean when we say &#39;before.&#39; I hope that these songs resonate with a world of uncertainty, frustrations, and a reliable old car with unreliable audio capabilities and stuffed to the brim with irreplaceable friends.</p><p>One of my favourite memories is of my first vehicle, an Aerostar mini van, bought in high school after months of 12 hour shifts every Saturday and Sunday. When you&#39;re in a band, you need a van to play all the garages, ballet studios, and basements. The freedom of your first car that could hold a packed crowd on drives around South Western Ontario. The world opened up. And as the world opens up and we see more, we end up with songs like &#39;RCMPig.&#39; What we see isn&#39;t always what&#39;s there and the song is about the racism and brutality from the RCMP and the overwhelming dishonesty of world leaders. There&#39;s a bit of everything on this four-song record.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Where else can you hear a love song for a van just a hop, skip, and a jump away from an excerpt from <em>Manufacturing Consent</em>? Wilson recorded these four songs between March and May of 2020 in Guelph, with <a href="https://pillea.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Pillea</a>&#39;s Micah Brown mixing and editing from Montreal earlier this year.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=35582143/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://parttimecool.bandcamp.com/album/no-free-rides">No Free Rides by Part-time Cool</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p>Micah gives me a dollar for every newsletter mention, full disclosure.</p> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2021-09-24-you-gave-me-the-key/" rel=next title="Next article: You Gave Me The Key"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>You Gave Me The Key</div> <div class=pagination-date>September 24, 2021</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2021-09-09-boat-burner/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Boat Burner"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Boat Burner</div> <div class=pagination-date>September 9, 2021</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

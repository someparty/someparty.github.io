The Montreal print zine launched its label offshoot with the premiere of <a href="https://itchyself.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Itchy Self</a>, Joe Chamandy&#39;s post-<a href="https://protruders.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Protruders</a> proto-punk revival act, followed quickly by an LP from the retro-futurist synth-pop quartet <a href="https://nightlunch.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Night Lunch</a>. While those two records couldn&#39;t be more sonically dissimilar, together they feel like a perfect lead-in to the label&#39;s third release: CLR03 marks a return of Mark Sauner&#39;s <a href="https://thepinknoise.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Pink Noise</a>, with <em>Economy of Love</em> due March 12. While this, the band&#39;s eighth LP, seems to continue the project&#39;s trajectory of nihilistic new-wave, it also shows a marked step up in fidelity. The lead single &quot;Out of Step&quot; gives Sauner&#39;s acerbic deadpan more space than usual, positioning The Pink Noise as the talent in some oily dystopian dance club. While the band&#39;s tension remains (Mark&#39;s nothing if not agitated), there&#39;s perhaps a newfound sense of <em>cool</em> here.</p><p>The group&#39;s past work drew frequent comparisons to Suicide, Chrome, Pere Ubu, and The Fall. While those qualities remain, guitarist/keyboardist Graeme Langdon suggested adding Television Personalities and Happy Mondays to the list in a recent <a href="https://aquariumdrunkard.com/2021/02/12/the-pink-noise-economy-of-love/" class="" target=_blank>Aquarium Drunkard</a> feature. That article premiered the irradiated neon video for &quot;Out of Step,&quot; directed by Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://www.emilypelstring.com/" class="" target=_blank>Emily Pelstring</a>. You can check it out below.</p><p>This version of The Pink Noise features the group&#39;s core duo of Sauner and Langdon, with the latter handling most of the studio instrumentation. The record features contributions from Tara Desmond of <a href="https://submissives.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Submissives</a> on violin, Brooklyn&#39;s Gabby Smith on an assortment of horns, and Simone TB (<a href="https://www.partnerband.com" class="" target=_blank>Partner</a>, <a href="http://yousgirls.blogspot.ca/" class="" target=_blank>U.S. Girls</a>) on drums. <a href="https://babysitter.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Babysitter</a>&#39;s Garrett Johnson produced, mixed, mastered the record, while playing on a few of the tracks himself.</p><p>Celluloid Lunch is pressing a limited vinyl run of the LP, available as a bundle with the band&#39;s 2018 record <em>House of Cards</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_UoA3d1ogA" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=rick_white><span class=artist-title><a href="https://rickwhitearchive.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Rick White</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Peppermint</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Listen on <a href="https://rickwhitearchive.bandcamp.com/album/rick-covers-sloans-peppermint-ep-2021" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p><a href="https://rickwhitearchive.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Rick White</a> of Moncton indie rock legends <a href="https://www.subpop.com/artists/erics_trip" class="" target=_blank>Eric&#39;s Trip</a> recently surprised with a front-to-back cover of <a href="http://sloanmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sloan</a>&#39;s 1992 debut <em>Peppermint</em>. White commented on how the project came together at his Bandcamp site:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In December 2020 i came across a rough demo of Sloan&#39;s &#39;Lucky for me&#39; i recorded in 1995. I was just doing it for fun at the time, but hearing it again caused me to pull out their 1992 Peppermint ep for a fresh listen. It had been a long time and brought back a lot of nice memories.</p><p>That sent me into a month of going through all the Sloan albums again, watching youtube vids and live footage, catching up with them and thinking about those youthful days in the early 90&#39;s which were a very exciting time for both of our bands.</p><p>I woke up one day in the midst of all this with the riff to &#39;Marcus Said&#39; going around my head and had an urge to try recording a cover of it in a late 90&#39;s Elevator style. It turned out being quite enjoyable and i liked the results. Now here we are two weeks later and i&#39;ve got the whole Peppermint ep recorded. Ha. It&#39;s quite a different kinda guitar sound and drumming style from the original, but i kept the song structures, melodies and tempos faithful. I really like these tunes and wanted to retain that energy. To finish off the project i even spent a few hours remaking a version of the album cover photo with my face. Which i must say turned out pretty good.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Both bands ran in the same circles in their early days, with the Sloan&#39;s <a href="https://murderecords1.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Murderecords</a> label releasing the debut Eric&#39;s Trip EP <em>Peter</em> in April of 1993 as their second release.

The label commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In keeping with their more recent material, Dave Barton&#39;s songs reflect the North American experience of the diaspora with a tip of the newsboy cap to the Quebecois narrative and the lure of Boston and New York; blending truth and fiction, glory and sport, love and loss, darkness and despair, while introducing composites of individuals, companions, friends and foes met along the punk rock journey.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The group recorded <em>Down and Out</em> in Montreal, Vancouver, and Dundee, Scotland, between December 2019 and June 2020. It&#39;s the band&#39;s second full-length since their 2017 reunion record <em>Palace of the Fiend</em> (marking a return from a 13-year absence). The Peelers originally surfaced in the eastern Ontario township of North Glengarry in 1999. They now operate out of Montreal.

For me, the writing of this song marked the first public expression of my own experiences; they were no longer suppressed or muted but yelled in rage for the world to hear.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song&#39;s one of 11 slated to appear on the band&#39;s upcoming debut <em>DIPSHIT</em>, which finally lands next month after a long series of mishaps (COVID, of course, but also the unexpected closure of the UK label slated to release the record).

In a press release, the label detailed the creative history and tragic circumstances surrounding this release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;An iconic Canadian media figure, Sook-Yin Lee is an award-winning filmmaker, musician, actor and broadcaster who has immersed herself in myriad creative collaborations. Many of them were made with her life partner and frequent co-creator Adam Litovitz, including their 2015 ethereal electroacoustic album <em>jooj</em>. Though Adam passed away in 2019, his work with Sook-Yin lives on with <em>jooj two</em>, an unapologetic dive into playful art-pop and a document of a lost language between lovers...</p><p>While financial difficulties and external pressures contributed to the end of their romantic relationship, Sook-Yin and Adam remained best friends and creative partners. As he was busy with a soundtrack for Netflix, Adam gave Sook-Yin his blessing to continue working on their second album without him. Increasingly, Adam struggled with anxiety and depression, compounded by a prescription drug dependency that exacerbated insomnia and pain. Tragically, he died by suicide on June 16, 2019.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Lee eventually completed the record with assistance from engineer Steve Chahley (Partner, Ice Cream, U.S. Girls). You can preview it now through the slick synth-pop single &quot;Run Away With Her.&quot; The song also appears in a new video co-directed by Lee and <a href="http://hotgarbagemusic.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Hot Garbage</a> member Dylan Gamble. Notably, Lee and Gamble also recently teamed up to produce the feature-length film <a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/media/films/death-and-sickness/38e815a-01358e02253" class="" target=_blank><em>Death and Sickness</em></a>.

The band commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Written during the early stages of the pandemic, I wasn&#39;t really sure what I wanted to burn down, but something needed to go. My maternity leave should have ended, so I could go on tour and play rad festivals with my husband on parental leave. But suddenly we were two stay at home parents with two six month old babies, unable to perform or socialize, confined to the same routine, getting in each other&#39;s space and driving each other crazy. As I wrote, it became less about burning down what was pissing me off and more about lighting up my own fire and getting back to our normal.</p><p>Nearly a year from when this whole mess started, a lot of pent-up frustration remains, and if people haven&#39;t already, they are ready to explode.

We simply didn&#39;t know each other. Yet as I reminisce, I realize that I could tally up more face-to-face encounters with the man than I could with most musicians - there just always happened to be a stage monitor (or perhaps a merch table) between us. While I was dawn to Good&#39;s nimble guitar wizardry at every opportunity, he remained forever larger than life to me. I never broke past the stoic mystique of his stage presence. So while I&#39;ve grappled with the news of Dallas&#39; untimely death with a great deal of sorrow, those feelings remain wrapped in the otherworldly magic he projected as a performer. As familiar as it became, something enduringly surreal remains about the sound The Sadies created - double so the hands that helped deliver it.</p><p>I struggle to express this in more grounded terms, but it feels like the elves have sailed from the Grey Havens. Something old and noble&#39;s now lost, and while the world endures as it must, it&#39;s henceforth diminished. There won&#39;t be another.</p><p>Thankfully the personalities in Good&#39;s circle have far less abstractly Tolkienesque tributes to offer. <a href="http://vishkhanna.com/" class="" target=_blank>Vish Khanna</a>&#39;s connection with the band runs deep, and alongside penning Exclaim&#39;s <a href="https://exclaim.ca/music/article/remembering_dallas_good_of_the_sadies" class="" target=_blank>obituary</a>, he put his thoughts fourth on the <a href="http://vishkhanna.com/2022/02/18/ep-669-dallas-good-remembered/" class="" target=_blank>Kreative Kontrol</a> podcast. Likewise, Damian Abraham&#39;s <a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/8036082-rip-dallas-good" class="" target=_blank>Turned Out A Punk</a> called up Jonah Falco to discuss Good&#39;s legacy, with some personal anecdotes from his time in <a href="https://careersuicide.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Career Suicide</a>. The discussion exemplifies how several eras of punk, hardcore and roots music seemed to find common ground through Dallas Good.</p><p>Good&#39;s ability to bridge genre silos played a massive part in my own growth as a music fan, and undoubtedly coloured my current trajectory. While 2004 found me in the thick of my Punknews tenure, I had little interest in covering the emo upstarts who were then in vogue, instead privately binging on <em>Favourite Colours</em> and Neko Case&#39;s Sadies-backed <em>The Tigers Have Spoken</em>. It always astonished me that The Sadies commanded my attention despite Good&#39;s history with the scene - I certainly wasn&#39;t aware of it then. The quality of their music was self-evident and indisputable.</p><p><a href="https://rickwhitearchive.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Rick White</a> of <a href="https://www.subpop.com/artists/erics_trip" class="" target=_blank>Eric&#39;s Trip</a> and Elevator shared a long kinship with Good, notably performing alongside him (and the entirety of The Sadies lineup) in the early 2000s supergroup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unintended" class="" target=_blank>The Unintended</a>. He issued a new recording dubbed &quot;Message to Dallas,&quot; a heartfelt reworking of the song &quot;Riverview Fog&quot; from The Sadies&#39; 2017 LP <em>Northern Passages</em>, as a tribute to his lost friend. Good wrote the original as an homage to White, who&#39;s returned the favour and reworked it from his perspective.

A press release reveals just a few of the references the PEI group packs into the two-minute track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The Burning Hell kick out the jams with a celebratory and wordy indictment of the hustle, the side-hustle, and all the personal and societal destruction that late-capitalism has wrought. Speedy rhyming references to Plato, The Lord Of The Rings, the Situtationists, and a whole world of self-help clichés are fuel for a Promethean fire (also referenced) that forges a new life from the garbage and debris of the old.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Birdwatching&quot; features Kom, Ariel Sharratt, Jake Nicoll, and Darren Browne. Look for <em>Garbage Island</em> later this year though <a href="https://bbislandmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>BB*Island</a> in Europe and <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> in North America.

The 7-song collection arrived alongside a video for the shout-along single &quot;Eat Slay Chardonnay.&quot; In a statement, bassist/vocalist Kathryn McCaughey reflected on the record&#39;s ethos:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>Live Your Truth Shred Some Gnar</em> is about needing to believe in something. For us, that&#39;s ourselves. Believing that we can and will do it. You have to live your truth and cannot lose sight of who you are. Even when you feel like a loser cleaning puke out of the bathroom sink, or because of rejection, heartache, and a seemingly never-ending list of reasons to give up. You have to shred some gnar because you are the only person who gets to live your own life.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Alan Hildebrandt of <a href="https://priorsmtl.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>PRIORS</a> directed the clip through <a href="https://www.studiodelscorpio.com/" class="" target=_blank>Studio Del Scorpio</a> (it follows similarly wild visuals he produced for Quebec punks FRVITS and New Vogue).</p><p>Thomas D&#39;Arcy (Yukon Blonde, The Sheepdogs) produced NOBRO&#39;s new record, with Dave Schiffman (PUP, The OBGMs) mixing. It follows the Montreal quartet&#39;s memorable 2020 debut, <em>Sick Hustle</em>.

This track stems from studio time spent <a href="https://monopolizedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Monopolized Records</a> principal Corey Bonnevie (of <a href="https://lylm.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Little You, Little Me</a> and <a href="https://doctormotherfather.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Doctor Mother Father</a>). Brown had this to say regarding the track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;All I Want&#39; was written during fall 2020. Corey (Bonnevie) had approached me about doing something in his studio. I was down but didn&#39;t have a song ready. We agreed to book some time when I did, and I got to work writing. Fall always makes me feel folky. In my mind I&#39;m wearing plaid, playing acoustic guitar in the woods. Maybe there&#39;s a river. We fleshed it out between lockdowns and other projects over the following year. I played all of the instruments; Corey recorded, mixed and mastered the track.</p><p>Originally it was slower, in standard tuning. Then I read a biography of Joni Mitchell (from whom I borrowed the title) and started messing with open tunings. Found one that worked for this song, realized it was DADGAD, which is more commonly associated with Neil Young (he calls it D modal). I&#39;d recently learned his &quot;Pardon My Heart&quot;, which uses it, and realized I could steal some chords. Made the song strummier, so then I wanted it to be faster (to be honest there may be a part of my brain that&#39;s always worried whether a song is &#39;punk enough&#39;) - somewhere between the Sadies&#39; &#39;Postcards&#39; and &#39;Idle Tomorrows&#39;.</p><p>Inspired by current events at the time - the pandemic, politics, polarization, protests, and people - as filtered through social media. The lyrics are about the idea that the ego needs an enemy. Wanting someone else to be wrong so you can be right. The disease of our discourse, in my opinion. None of this was supposed to be particularly relevant when it finally got released, but here we are.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song&#39;s a quick follow-up to the first volume in the Uppers&#39; <em>Official Bootleg Series</em>, a live EP that arrived in January.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=156814915/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://sunnysideuppers.bandcamp.com/track/all-i-want">All I Want by Sunnyside Uppers</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=scott_murray><span class=artist-title><a href="https://tarantulacassettes.bandcamp.com/album/the-old-and-the-cold" class="" target=_blank>Scott Murray</a></span><span class=media-title><em>The Old and The Cold</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://tarantulacassettes.bandcamp.com/album/the-old-and-the-cold" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Scott Murray of Barrie, Ontario punk trio <a href="https://thehighdives.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Highdives</a> recently issued a solo acoustic set dubbed <em>The Old and The Cold</em>.

The band&#39;s Evan Resnik directed the black and white visuals accompanying the track. He commented in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Out of my Skull&#39; is dark but it&#39;s lively. I shot in black and white to lend a bit of a classic, noir vibe to the video, which also helped bring out some of my innate 90s influence.</p><p>The lyrics loosely reference Miles Davis and a few moments from his life: his hiatus from 1975-80, a shooting in 1969, being assaulted by a cop outside Birdland in 1959. I watched a lot of music documentaries in early 2020 when we began writing this record. Miles was a mysterious and brooding artist, and that initial inspiration helped me get into that mindset during songwriting and throughout the video production. The video is intimate but detached, with close-up faces in contrasting, unreal environments. We&#39;re in your face, but we&#39;re not really there.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The 13-song LP arrives on March 25 through the Montreal psych label.

The band launched into a new era with a revamp of their early song &quot;Once.&quot; They commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;If you don&#39;t know who we are, Handheld started in the late 90&#39;s when a bunch of highschool kids started playing in our parents basement. We released a bunch of albums and played all around Canada for the better part of 10 years. Handheld disbanded in 2008 but we always kept close. Some of us started playing in <a href="https://curbsidepunk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Curbside</a>. In 2018 we started talking about putting together a few Handheld reunion shows and we started practicing again and we even re-recorded a few really old songs for fun. When the pandemic hit, all plans for a reunion went on hold. So we started writing again and before we knew it we had a whole album.</p><p>So before this new album drops, we went back into the archive and polished off of the very first songs we ever wrote. So here it is, a 22 year old song, re-written once again. Any ultra hardcore HH fans (the kind that live in their parents basements) will know this as the first track off the Homebrew album.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Once (Again)&quot; arrives alongside a video collage of photos from the band&#39;s early years. Handheld issued a half dozen releases in their original incarnation, cumulating in a self-titled full-length in 2008.

The new record arrives following 2019&#39;s slow-burning instrumental <em>Living Memory</em> and marks Apollo Ghosts&#39; first outing as a full band since 2012&#39;s <em>Landmark</em>.</p><p>Look for <em>Pink Tiger</em> on March 11 through <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3ArdbgWmX0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=we_are_time><span class=artist-title><a href="https://wearetime.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>We Are Time</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Chandra Mixtape Vol. 2</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Purchase at <a href="https://wearetime.bandcamp.com/album/chandra-mixtape-vol-2" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> - Preview on <a href="https://youtu.be/iKrSnysedSw" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>The <a href="https://wearetime.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>We Are Time</a> label recently issued the second volume in their <em>Chandra Mixtape</em> series, focusing on new projects from the extended social circle of Canadian musicians who back New York post-punk veteran <a href="https://chandrachandra.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chandra</a> Oppenheim.

I was in fifth grade when it seemingly dominated all of western culture, and hearing but a note of it hurls me back to a time when I held no musical opinion other than a persistent state of annoyance. I suffer anew thanks to Allie Hanlon&#39;s bubblegum-punk act <a href="http://peachkellipop.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Peach Kelli Pop</a>, who cover the song along with two others on <em>Hardcovers</em>, an EP arriving April 15.</p><p>If you don&#39;t share from my particular childhood trauma, you can hear the track on Bandcamp or pick it up on a limited flexi disc through <a href="https://www.lauren-records.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lauren Records</a>. This rendition finds the group playing as a three-piece with Allison Young on bass and Pete Sosa drumming.</p><p>While now based in Long Beach, California, Hanlon&#39;s project has its roots up in frosty Ottawa where she drummed for Ontario garage-punk heroes <a href="https://thewhitewires.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The White Wires</a>. <em>Hardcovers</em> follows Peach Kelli Pop&#39;s 2020 EP <em>Lucky Star</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1974552523/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://peachkellipop.bandcamp.com/album/hardcovers">Hardcovers by Peach Kelli Pop</a></iframe> </body></html> </div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2022-03-10-searching-for-you/" rel=next title="Next article: Searching for You"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>Searching for You</div> <div class=pagination-date>March 10, 2022</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2022-02-18-every-lover-knows/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Every Lover Knows"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Every Lover Knows</div> <div class=pagination-date>February 18, 2022</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

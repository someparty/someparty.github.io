I drove around Cape Breton, searching for the right moment to propose to my girlfriend to the chorus of Attack In Black&#39;s &quot;Northern Towns.&quot; Is that song actually appropriate to the occasion of professing one&#39;s love on a cliff overlooking the Northumberland Strait? Beats me, but it sounded good. I started this newsletter frustrated with the treadmill of covering daily music news to Daniel Romano&#39;s &quot;Modern Pressure.&quot; Like so many of my peers, I parsed mantras from the Constantines&#39; &quot;Young Lions&quot; to fit every imaginable purpose. Those are just my on-brand Cancon examples. My teenage years were no better. I&#39;m loath to admit sitting around in a K-car in a St. Catharines mall parking lot, listening to Less Than Jake&#39;s &quot;Al&#39;s War&quot; and deciding it spoke precisely to how much we needed to escape the fact that we were sitting around in a K-car in a St. Catharines mall parking lot. Heck, I stocked a produce freezer as a know-it-all 14-year-old while &quot;I&#39;m So Bored With the U.S.A.&quot; confirmed my obviously flawless takes on mid-90s geopolitics.</p><p><a href="https://shotgunjimmie.net/" class="" target=_blank>Shotgun Jimmie</a>&#39;s &quot;The New Sincerity&quot; feels like one of those songs. I&#39;m not entirely sure what it means, but I am absolutely on board. I <em>am</em> ready for the new sincerity. Sign me up. Nothing else makes much sense. The tattoo goes here.</p><p>As for Jimmie&#39;s interpretation, he commented on his website:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Are you ready for The New Sincerity? We&#39;ve released a new single from my forth coming record. Available for streaming here. Essentially, it&#39;s the record&#39;s manifesto. It&#39;s actually a manifesto I wrote for an art history class. I got an A+!!! Hopefully you like it as much as my prof did. The song was inspired by a T-shirt Paul Henderson made for me at a Sackville art party. Thanks Paul. Thanks Post-Post-Modernism. Thanks You&#39;ve Changed Records. Thank you fine listener.</p></blockquote><p>All clear?</p><p>The song&#39;s the second single release from the fast-approaching sequel to 2011&#39;s <em>Transistor Sister</em>, aptly titled <em>Transistor Sister 2</em>. The album arrives on <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> on Friday, August 2, coinciding with Jimmie&#39;s triumphant return to Sackville, New Brunswick&#39;s <a href="http://www.sappyfest.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sappyfest</a> as the Saturday night headliner the following evening.</p><p>While Jimmie&#39;s regularly released music since that fan-favourite album (most recently <em>Field of Trampolines</em> in 2016 and the first <a href="https://theheatdeath.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Heat Death</a> record last year ), the new full length serves as a direct response to that the original <em>Transistor Sister</em>. Jimmie commented earlier that he intended to &quot;recreate the immersive experience of making the original&quot; by working with a full band in a self-contained studio session.</p><p>This record features Jim Kilpatrick backed by Ryan Peters of <a href="https://ladyhawk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ladyhawk</a>, Jay Baird of <a href="http://domakesaythink.com/" class="" target=_blank>Do Make Say Think</a>, and José Miguel Contreras of <a href="https://bydivineright.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>By Divine Right</a>. It was recorded and produced by Contreras at The Chat Chateaux in Toronto. The album&#39;s first single &quot;Cool All The Time,&quot; featured a guest monologue from <a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chad VanGaalen</a>, with the work also featuring instrumentation from the Cons&#39; <a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a> and <a href="https://humanmusic.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Human Music</a>&#39;s Cole Woods.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3731652709/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=378442733/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://shotgunjimmie.bandcamp.com/album/transistor-sister-2">Transistor Sister 2 by Shotgun Jimmie</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://shotgunjimmie.bandcamp.com/track/the-new-sincerity" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Shotgun Jimmie - &quot;The New Sincerity&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p><a href="https://washingmachine.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Washing Machine</a>, the Halifax quartet spearheaded by Noel Macdonald (<a href="http://moonhalifax.tumblr.com" class="" target=_blank>Moon</a>, <a href="https://longweekends.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Long Weekends</a>, <a href="https://donlovely.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Don Lovely</a>) has a new single online titled &quot;Act of War.&quot; It&#39;s the band&#39;s first follow-up to their 2018 full-length <em>Walk It Back</em>, which saw Macdonald establish an indie rock sound heavily influenced by 80s new wave and college rock, taking queues from classics like The Smiths.</p><p>Washing Machine features Macdonald on guitar and vocals backed by members of the astonishingly interconnected Halifax heavy music scene: guitarist Dylan Chew (<a href="https://unrealthought.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Unreal Thought</a>, <a href="https://frailhands.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Frail Hands</a>), bassist Cody Googoo (<a href="https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Booji Boys</a>, <a href="https://alienation902.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Alienation</a>), and drummer Tom Burke (<a href="https://kingsgirls.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>King&#39;s Girls</a>, Frail Hands).</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=914935222/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://washingmachine.bandcamp.com/track/act-of-war">Act of War by Washing Machine</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://washingmachine.bandcamp.com/track/act-of-war" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Washing Machine - &quot;Act of War&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Toronto avant-pop artist <a href="https://scotthardware.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Scott Hardware</a> has signed with <a href="https://www.telephoneexplosion.com/" class="" target=_blank>Telephone Explosion</a> for a new album due in 2020. While still untitled, the record has a debut single out now in the form of &quot;Bound Together.&quot; The new track combines acoustic instrumentation with the electronic effects Hardware&#39;s spent the past few years iterating on. The song was recorded live off the floor with Carlyn Bezic (of the synthpop duo <a href="https://icecreeeammm.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ice Cream</a>) and Simone Tisshaw-Baril (Darlene Shrugg, Fake Palms, Partner) as his rhythm section. <a href="https://deidre999.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Deidre Nox</a> provides backing vocals on the track.</p><p>&quot;Bound Together&quot; is Hardware&#39;s first new release since 2016&#39;s full-length <em>Mutate Repeat Infinity</em>. Scott commented on the sweeping, cinematic new direction explored in the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Originally the new music was supposed to be house-inspired but I wanted to take out the drums and move towards the emotional core of dance music without a beat distracting. It still references Detroit electro and house in smaller ways, while scratching my itch to be able to write songs that were timeless enough be played with one instrument and one voice (and also incorporate my love for meta experimental music, production-wise.)&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Scott Hardware&#39;s been a long-running member of the Toronto music community, with roots in the experimental Kensington Market-based psych group <a href="https://ostrichtuning.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ostrich Tuning</a>. He started recording solo in 2013 while living in Berlin, experimenting with drum machines as <a href="https://soundcloud.com/scotthardware/sets/ken-park-you-think-about-it" class="" target=_blank>Ken Park</a>. Relocating back to Toronto in 2015, Hardware pushed into dance music with <em>Mutate Repeat Infinity</em>. &quot;Bound Together&quot; seems to show a new synthesis of these often divergent ventures.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=300 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/652760204&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" class=lazyload></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/telephoneexplosion/bound-together-master-1" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Scott Hardware - &quot;Bound Together&quot; @ Soundcloud</a></p><p><a name=pacer></a>Last week at Punknews, I premiered a new song from Toronto&#39;s up and coming three-piece <a href="https://pacerto.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Pacer</a>. Their stand-alone single &quot;Rapture&quot; sounds absolutely exuberant, which is surprising given it was conceived in the wake of a psychotic episode suffered by lead vocalist Shawn Kosmo. The trio, which features Kosmo on vocals and guitar backed by bassist Dan Pearce and drummer Evan Matthews, draws from 80s college rock and 70s proto-punk, with a particular love for the Replacements and Pixes shining through.</p><p>The press release digs into the band&#39;s spin on the potentially touchy subject matter driving the song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Rapture&quot; is a song about psychosis and mental health, but instead of channeling the weight of the topic, the group seeks to tap into their exuberant side to purge the demons. The song sheds the stigma of discussing mental health by channeling that energy in the studio and on stage. Shaw n&#39;s lived experiences with mental health disorders has challenged him to find a way to explore new avenues for coping with difficult subjects. If he can&#39;t talk about them, then he&#39;ll sing about them at the top of his lungs.</p><p>...As a band with a queer-identifying frontman, Pacer also believes that the future of rock and roll is bright for those who aren&#39;t straight or gender conforming.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Pacer last released the digital singles &quot;Bangers&quot; and &quot;Piledriver&quot;/&quot;Lose,&quot; both of which can be found at <a href="http://pacerto.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a>. Before stepping into the spotlight with Pacer, you may have encountered Shawn Kosmo&#39;s work as a video director, having put together clips for bands like PONY, Twist, and Tommy and the Commies.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=3510664849/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://pacerto.bandcamp.com/track/rapture">Rapture by Pacer</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/70332/torontos-pacer-get-cathartic-on-new-single-rapture" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Pacer - &quot;Rapture&quot; @ Punknews.org</a></p><p>Sydney J.

Here&#39;s what Fucked Up&#39;s Jonah Falco had this to say about <em>14 Lashes</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Like a door opening to an alternate universe where Suburban Mutilation released the most influential hardcore LP of the 80s, and DOA were conveniently disappeared so the melody cum velocity and Richard Nixon-esque gargle of Joey Shithead could be reimagined in the various voids of the Twenty-teens as tidy new hc punk lp by CHAIN WHIP. Not fast enough to only be brutal, but not modest enough to be anything but pummelling. Full of burly, crunchy, tight corners, this is the musical equivalent of thrifting an Eames chair -- you recognize it a mile away, it&#39;s still a classic, and it&#39;s just landed in our laps for next to nothing.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Chain Whip is Josh Nickel of <a href="https://fashionism.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fashionism</a> (and the <a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Neon Taste</a> label) on vocals, Joel Butler of <a href="https://nervoustalk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nervous Talk</a>/Corner Boys on guitar, Brett Thompson of <a href="https://stresseating.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stress Eating</a> on bass, and Patrick Bertrand of <a href="https://cornerboys.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Corner Boys</a> (and <a href="https://hoseheadrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hosehead Records</a>) on drums. A European release of the LP has been slated for <a href="https://sabotagerecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sabotage Records</a> sometime later this year.

It&#39;s something that I&#39;ve heard expressed by a lot of friends in one way or another, especially as more and more people are getting priced out of cities like Toronto, New York and London. There can be plenty of good reasons to leave the place that you&#39;re from or somewhere you&#39;ve made your home for a long time, but I think there&#39;s this &#39;grass is always greener&#39; thing that in my experience, and anecdotally from people I know, just isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s hard to move to a new place, and you&#39;re still going to be you when you get there with the same issues and hang-ups, plus you&#39;re going to miss the people who care about you, and they&#39;re going to miss you.&quot;</p></blockquote><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=193437734/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://ducksunlimitedband.bandcamp.com/track/get-bleak-single">Get Bleak (single) by Ducks Unlimited</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://ducksunlimitedband.bandcamp.com/track/get-bleak-single" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Ducks Unlimited - &quot;Get Bleak&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Montreal&#39;s <a href="https://thousandislandsrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Thousand Islands Records</a> have signed Edmonton skate-punk act <a href="http://loserpoints.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Loser Points</a>.

While the five-piece plays with traditional folk elements, they&#39;re anchored by Amelia Harris&#39; oft-haunting vocals, with many songs straddling a really fascinating middle ground between folk, indie, and psychedelia. The band commented on the meaning behind the album&#39;s title, and the fact that roots music was something they&#39;ve had to reconnect with:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Spring Var was formed shortly after every member moved back to Newfoundland following stints living in Montreal and Toronto. <em>Come Home Year</em> refers to the celebrations that take place across Newfoundland, designed to draw past residents back to their rural hometowns. This band was our own Come Home Year project that pushed us outside our comfort zones (most of us had never played folk/traditional music before) and helped us reconnect with our friends and musical roots. &quot;</p></blockquote><p>Spring Var features Harris on vocals, banjo and synth, Chris Scott on bass, Christina Young on drums and fiddle, Michelle LaCour on accordion and synth, and Robert Forward on guitar, mandolin and bodhran.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1218981982/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://springvar.bandcamp.com/album/come-home-year">COME HOME YEAR by Spring Var</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://springvar.bandcamp.com/album/come-home-year" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Spring Var - <em>Come Home Year</em> @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Kitchener&#39;s dynamic indie-pop/shoegaze quartet <a href="https://hyness.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Hyness</a> has a wealth of new material online.

With the confirmation came another new single, &quot;Phone Ring.&quot;</p><p>A complete contrast from the high-stress, often acidic punk of Single Mothers, the Foundation lets Drew show off some considerable pop songwriting chops. These two worlds aren&#39;t being kept entirely separate though, as the former&#39;s &quot;People are Pets&quot; has been reworked on this album as a Rufus Wainwright-styled piano ballad. Thomson worked on the record with producer Alex Newport at his Los Angeles studio (Pissed Jeans, City and Colour, Frank Turner).</p><p>Thomson&#39;s recent sobriety factors heavily into the record. He commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;By drinking a decade away, I also pushed away a lot of people close to me. People had been telling me to quit for years and I never listened to them. You really have to want to get sober and believe it&#39;s for the best. I don&#39;t ask anyone else in the band to avoid drinking, but if I have one or two I slip back into that other world, so I just avoid it completely. It&#39;s been a huge benefit. I write more, I work better, I&#39;m less reactive, and easier to be around. I just have to handle self-doubt on my own. I don&#39;t want to base everything I do around sobriety, but it&#39;s been the biggest thing in my life lately, and made everything with the Foundation possible.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This record follows up The Drew Thomson Foundation&#39;s 2018 EP <em>Stay</em>, as well as the recent Single Mothers record <em>Through a Wall</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-x1GN25y1ag" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/-x1GN25y1ag" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: The Drew Thomson Foundation - &quot;Phone Ring&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Winnipeg garage rock/psych quartet <a href="https://holyvoidband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Holy Void</a> will release their debut full-length at the end of the month through <a href="http://www.transistor66.com/" class="" target=_blank>Transistor 66</a>.

Despite that, it&#39;s rare that I find a reason to mention my hometown here. Sure, the <em>region</em>&#39;s well represented in Some Party: a thousand songs have sprung from the garden of Welland&#39;s <a href="https://attackinblack.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Attack In Black</a>, and the suburban youth army following St. Catharines&#39; <a href="https://www.theonlybandever.com/" class="" target=_blank>Alexisonfire</a> built the Dine Alone empire. Indeed if you live here (and don&#39;t have to rely on public transit) the boundaries between the named sub-sections of the Niagara Region can seem fairly meaningless. From that perspective, I certainly share a tinge of quasi-hometown pride for every Daniel Romano phase-shift and every ridiculous Dboy manifesto.</p><p>On the other hand, with strict adherence to our municipal boundaries, Niagara Falls comes up woefully short. We&#39;re hollowed out. We&#39;re an art desert. Our downtown evaporated in the 70s, and the city&#39;s money tends to unsurprisingly flow to where the tourists go. If you want to see a band in Niagara Falls (and not in a casino), with a few rare exceptions that means you&#39;re driving to St. Catharines (or you&#39;re three basements deep in some house show scene I&#39;m not young or cool enough to know about).</p><p>Doug Ford could flash-amalgamate the lot of us next week, but at least at the moment, it&#39;s rare I see a band cross my plate with &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; touted in their bio, less so a glorious anachronism of youth crew hardcore like <a href="https://wildsidehc.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Wild Side</a>.</p><p>A few years after their early demos caused some buzz in hardcore circles, the group came roaring back into the news last week with word of their first full-length. The <em>Who The Hell Is Wild Side</em> LP will come to light on Boston&#39;s <a href="https://bbbrecords.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Triple B Records</a> on May 7. The 10-track set will include the single &quot;Street Action,&quot; a mid-tempo rager that proudly wears the influence of genre-staples like Warzone and Murphy&#39;s Law.</p><p>The cover art finds the title plastered across a billboard overlooking the kitschy intersection at the top of Clifton Hill. While, like most locals, I&#39;ve got no love for the tourist cheese, the pang of familiarity certainly has my interest piqued. NFHC, folks.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1205454961/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://bbbrecords.bandcamp.com/album/who-the-hell-is-wild-side">Who The Hell Is WILD SIDE? by Wild Side</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://bbbrecords.bandcamp.com/album/who-the-hell-is-wild-side" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Wild Side - &quot;Street Action&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Toronto lo-fi rock duo <a href="https://low--sun.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Low Sun</a> will return this year with a fresh collection of songs titled <em>New/Shiny</em>, it&#39;s the group&#39;s follow-up to their 2017 album <em>Reservoir of Impermanent Light</em>. On Friday I premiered the first single from the record over at Punknews.org, a crunchy slow-burning song titled &quot;Don&#39;t Hesitate.&quot; The often understated band gave me a suitably sly comment on the song, stating &quot;We left it open, the door to the henhouse... the fox slid right in.&quot;</p><p>Low Sun features the brothers Peter and Robert Johnson, the principles behind the <a href="https://www.artoftheuncarvedblock.com/" class="" target=_blank>Art of the Uncarved Block</a> label who formerly played together as Shahman. The band sent over a little history lesson leading up to this record:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Low Sun began sometime in 2017. They self-recorded a full length on a finicky 1⁄4 inch tape recorder in the middle of winter in a cabin on the edge of a frozen, moaning lake, without running water, heat or much light. The experience produced <em>Reservoir of Impermanent Light</em>, a droney rock album that probably wasn’t the best thing to make in 2017, but they liked it so off it went into the world. After the release they toured Eastern Europe, from the mountains of Slovakia to the mouth of the Baltic sea. The album also took them to Japan and a short round of performances in Hong Kong. Now, two years later, they present to you, <em>New/Shiny</em>, a collection of songs that took way too long to record. After spending nearly 8 months with a new bass player, the bass player ended up leaving a month before their 2 week European tour with Czech hardcore band, DNO. They re-wrote the entire EP, wrote more songs, and self-recorded it in one day. Born again as a self-described post-industry, loser-rock band, Low Sun awaits their next leap of faith.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Low Sun will promote the new release with a two-week European tour kicking off the last week of April. Those dates can be found at Punknews. The exact release date for *New/Shiny&quot; has not yet been confirmed.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=166 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/604723230&amp;color=%238c7c94&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" class=lazyload> </iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/69593/low-sun-premieres-dont-hesitate-from-upcoming-new-shiney-ep" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Low Sun - &quot;Don&#39;t Hesitate&quot; @ Punknews.org</a></p><p>I had the privilege last week of premiering more weird and wild sounds from Montreal art-punk duo <a href="http://crabe.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>CRABE</a>. The band&#39;s gearing up to release their 7th record, <em>Notre-Dame de la vie intérieure</em>, this spring on <a href="https://www.lepantoum.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pantoum Records</a>. Over at Punknews I shared the new video for the riffy and raucous &quot;Le monde entier.&quot; It&#39;s the third single the band&#39;s revealed in recent months, following &quot;Festival&quot; and &quot;Livre compliqué.&quot;</p><p>I asked the often oblique band about the new track and got a very satisfyingly-CRABE description back:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Le monde entier&#39; is inspired by shared feelings about wars in the whole world, the wars as we know them. The global destructive wars on earth and the one sometimes inside people or between them. Lost people looking for a better self using toxic or bad ways to find light. And the peace of the mind when the wars are over, when you achieve the non-judgmental big lyfe, the energy lifestyle.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The trippy video by Katerine DM features animated seahorses, so you&#39;re pretty much obliged to watch.</p><p>CRABE is a duo pairing Gabriel Lapierre and Mertin Höek. They came together first in the southwestern Quebec town of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield before relocating to Montreal. Guillaume Chiasson of the Quebec City garage rock duo <a href="https://ponctuationponctuation.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ponctuation</a> produced this new material.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wk1ecNV5ynY" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"> </iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://www.punknews.org/article/69559/media-melt-down-to-le-monde-entier-from-quebecs-aggressively-weird-crabe" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: CRABE - &quot;Le monde entier&quot; @ Punknews.org</a></p><p>I nurtured a mild obsession with Toronto&#39;s rootsy and raucous <a href="http://bruce-peninsula.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bruce Peninsula</a> in the years preceding Some Party, but they&#39;ve been off-grid for the span of this newsletter&#39;s existence.

Let&#39;s make a video. Let&#39;s make a trailer.&#39; We went. He made all the things. I played shooting and ball toss games and won three stuffed animals and two inflatable swords.

The first to arrive is the song &quot;Talkin&#39; Shit.&quot; Vocalist/guitarist Ross Carvelli has this to say about the accompanying lyric video:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The video came together quite quickly after we settled on the concept and sourced enough weird objects to write lyrics on. We shot and edited it in one day. The animation took a little longer, but we did everything ourselves. It was a lot of fun and very liberating.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>It&#39;s a fun tune.

This is the first release after their appearance at Toronto’s Not Dead Yet Festival and hot on the heels of their 2018 releases on Warthog Speak and Neon Taste. Feel the shellshock.

Titled &quot;The Craft,&quot; the song premiered alongside a video directed by Bronwyn Ford and Max Taeuschel. The band commented on the clip in the press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;With ‘The Craft’ we wanted to explore the unconscious oddities of everyday life and how an outsider alien ([vocalist Austin Boylan]&#39;s character) may interpret these trivial actions. In the video each band member has a niche hobby that not only lends itself to blind emulation from the outsider, but also represents each member&#39;s individuality within our collective project.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;The Craft&quot; will appear on <em>No. 1</em>, the band&#39;s debut EP arriving May 10 on <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain</a> and <a href="http://www.partisanrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Partisan Records</a>. The group recorded the set over two nights, cutting live to tape and wrapping songs in a single take. Pottery features Boylan backed by guitarist Jacob Shepansky, keyboardist Peter Baylis, bassist Tom Gould, and drummer Paul Jacobs.</p><p>Later this year the group will hit the road for a North American tour supporting Dublin&#39;s Fontaines D.C. They&#39;ll also appear at several festivals, including the Iceland Airwaves festival in Reykjavík, and northern Ontario&#39;s River and Sky.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC_k3hQL0zg" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/EC_k3hQL0zg" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Pottery - &quot;The Craft&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>A month after their single &quot;Porch,&quot; Vancouver grunge/punk quartet <a href="http://dead-soft.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dead Soft</a> is rolling out another new track titled &quot;The Static.&quot; We can only assume both tracks are destined for the eventual follow-up to the band&#39;s recent <a href="https://arts-crafts.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Arts &amp; Crafts</a> EP <em>New Emotion</em>. &quot;The Static,&quot; finds the group taking a more measured and atmospheric tone, with bassist Keeley Rochon taking lead vocal duties.

It marks the band&#39;s return as a collaborative unit following singer/guitarist Cole Zachary&#39;s 2017 solo EP <em>Space Camp</em> (released, perhaps confusingly, under the Merin name). On this record, the band features Zachary alongside guitarist Kathryn Kerr, bassist Jordan Cayer, and drummer Joel Klaverkamp. Speaking to <a href="https://comeherefloyd.com/premiere-merin-coral-island/" class="" target=_blank>Come Here Floyd</a>, where they premiered the title track, the group commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Coral Island&#39; is a song about escape from mental illness and a menial existence. The idea that depression and anxiety can simply be left behind on this planet is obviously fantastical, so it requires an equally fantastical solution: May as well go to space!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>J Riley Hill (Living Hour, Basic Nature) recorded and produced the album. Carl Saff (Mitski, Guided By Voices, Speedy Ortiz) handled the mastering. Merin will kick off a 13-city tour supporting <em>Coral Island</em> The Apollo in Thunder Bay on May 3.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 700px; max-width: 100%; height: 120px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4282008330/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="http://merinmusic.bandcamp.com/album/coral-island-ep">Coral Island EP by Merin</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="http://merinmusic.bandcamp.com/album/coral-island-ep" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Merin - &quot;Coral Island&quot; @ Bandcamp</a></p><p>Toronto singer-songwriter <a href="https://islacraig.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Isla Craig</a> shared a live video last week for the song &quot;Young Woman.&quot; Her performance was captured at the now-defunct Kensington Market art space Double Double Land, recorded and edited by Craig&#39;s frequent collaborator Victoria Cheong (<a href="https://www.newchance.biz/" class="" target=_blank>New Chance</a>).

Titled <em>1978</em>, the album will collect 21 previously unreleased demos, rare tracks, and early singles. The label had this to say about the track listing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The two constants on the album are Joey [Shithead Keithley] and Chuck Biscuits, who play on every track. From the start of 1978 begins their wild, &#39;I don’t give a shit&#39; approach to punk rock. Now some forty years later one can hear it all, starting with the never-seen-the-light-of-day demo version of &#39;The Enemy&#39;. This demo has a different set of lyrics that speaks to fighting Nazis—strange, what is old is new and vital again. There’s a ton of exciting tracks that range from the never heard before, such as &#39;Bored And Suicidal&#39;, &#39;The Mutant&#39;, &#39;No God No War&#39;, &#39;Rip Dis Joint&#39;, &#39;No Way Out&#39; and &#39;Rent-A-Riot&#39;, to classic early singles like &#39;Fucked Up Ronnie&#39;, &#39;Disco Sucks&#39;, &#39;World War 3&#39;, &#39;The Prisoner&#39; and &#39;13&#39;. Also included are demo versions of &#39;America The Beautiful&#39; and &#39;Liar For Hire&#39; with Biscuits drumming, which are wildly different than the classic versions you hear on War On 45.</p><p>The track list ranges from classics like &#39;Disco Sucks&#39; and &#39;World War 3&#39; to never-before released recordings like &#39;Bored and Suicidal,&#39; &#39;The Mutant,&#39; &#39;No God No War&#39; and &#39;Rent-A-Riot.&#39; Storied early drummer Chuck Biscuits is also featured on demos of &#39;America the Beautiful&#39; and &#39;Liar for Hire.&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>1978</em> will arrive on the band&#39;s <a href="https://www.suddendeath.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sudden Death</a> label as a double LP and CD.</p> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2019-04-21-one-time-luv/" rel=next title="Next article: One Time Luv"> <span aria-hidden=true><</span> <div class="pagination-text right"> <div class=pagination-title>One Time Luv</div> <div class=pagination-date>April 21, 2019</div> </div> </a> </li> <li> <a href="/2019-04-07-club-nites/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Club Nites"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Club Nites</div> <div class=pagination-date>April 7, 2019</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

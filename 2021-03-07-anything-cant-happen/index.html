I write exclusively in a code editor, with every edition from 2017 onwards available as a text file in a quickly searchable repository. That means it&#39;s effortless to rifle through the entirety of Some Party&#39;s archives for past mentions of an artist. While this suggests, and I hope it&#39;s not too obvious, that I can lazily cannibalize my past work with ease - it also grants me a perspective on how an artist&#39;s factored into my skewed Cancon narrative over time.</p><p>Toronto singer <a href="https://dorotheapaas.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dorothea Paas</a> is a perfect case example of an individual that&#39;s appeared here a dozen times - but always as a supporting player. I see her frequently referenced as a collaborator with Twig Turnbull&#39;s <a href="https://badgeepoque.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Badge Ã‰poque Ensemble</a>, often spoken of in the same reverence as <a href="http://yousgirls.blogspot.ca/" class="" target=_blank>U.S. Girls</a>&#39; commanding Meg Remy and the ethereal <a href="https://jennifercastle.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jennifer Castle</a>. I see her referenced in stories about punk bands (opening for the Tough Age offshoot Rotten Column, or lending a drummer to Paul Lawton&#39;s Don&#39;t Bother). To date, though, she&#39;s never been at the center of the story. It&#39;s immensely satisfying when an artist on the periphery of my understanding suddenly steps into focus, even when I&#39;m late picking up on what everyone else already knew. In 2021, that spotlight&#39;s on Dorothea Paas.</p><p>Paas is set to release her debut solo album on May 7 via <a href="https://www.telephoneexplosion.com/" class="" target=_blank>Telephone Explosion</a>. <em>Anything Can&#39;t Happen</em> arrives as a collection of nine songs, intimate standards of Paas&#39; live show that have taken years to come together. While active for the better part of a decade, her recorded output&#39;s been confined to self-released cassettes. You can preview the record now through the title track, a song that circles back to the open-ended refrain &quot;anything can happen at any time.&quot; In a press release Paas muses on the ambiguity in the track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;These uncertainties remain in tension so that you can decide what you want the song to mean based on how you&#39;re feeling. I hope that this song facilitates some cathartic surrender to the fact that there is so much we can&#39;t control or resolve. There is not only fear but also possibly hope in the idea that we don&#39;t know what is coming.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Anything Can&#39;t Happen&quot; arrived alongside a video directed by Ryan Al-Hage (Commuted, Westelaken). Given that it was shot on location in my hometown, I&#39;ve rather predictably zoned in on Paas&#39; thoughts on using the city as a backdrop:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Ryan brought up the films of Wong Kar-wai as an inspiration and suggested a similar approach: pick a location and let the other details emerge from the setting. I love the model of improvisation within a structure in my music practice, and also like how this approach mirrors and multiplies the many possible interpretations of the song&#39;s lyrics.</p><p>A trip to Niagara Falls offers opportunities for self-exploration and self-obscurity. It feels very human to build something like Clifton Hill so as to exert some kind of control over the sublime. If the Falls render us insignificant or terrify us, we can remake them into a postcard or a keychain, and take them home. I can connect the video to my interpretation of the lyrics; maybe you will see it the same way as me, or maybe totally differently. I think that&#39;s what is exciting about this open-ended mode of filming.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Paas recorded <em>Anything Can&#39;t Happen</em> in Hamilton and Toronto, with both Badge Ãˆpoque&#39;s Max Turnbull and Steve Chahley (Partner, Ice Cream) mixing. Members of <a href="https://littlekid.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Little Kid</a> and <a href="https://bernice.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Bernice</a> appear on the record - with the core band featuring Liam Cole, Paul Saulnier, Robin Dann, and Thom Gill.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MNpcs5n7K0s" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=joncro><span class=artist-title><a href="https://joncro.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>JONCRO</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Passa Passa&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://joncro.bandcamp.com/track/passa-passa-4" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Mississauga trio <a href="https://joncro.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>JONCRO</a> came out swinging on &quot;Passa Passa,&quot; the first preview of their upcoming full-length <em>Richmond Station</em>. Daniel G. Wilson&#39;s dabbled in various styles over the past year, seeking the band&#39;s voice while chipping away at their time in isolation. This track channels all that restlessness into a tense and propulsive garage-punk number. In short order, the track sheds its vocals to shift into a cathartic instrumental jam. The band commented on Instagram:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Passa Passa is a Jamaican patois term that usually refers to gossip or confusion and domestic/public disharmony (often caused by said gossip). The song itself is a Garage-Math Punk track framed against the backdrop of a boxing match against a white shadow. Daniel wrote it during a difficult and tumultuous period in their personal life. It is meant to convey the disorientating feelings that come with betrayal, the end of friendships, imposter syndrome, dissociation, negative self image, and the anxiety that comes with being a marginalized person in a society that fights against you.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>JONCRO features Wilson on guitar and vocals, with drummer Matthew Mikuljan and bassist Kieran Christie. Wilson recorded the song at the band&#39;s home base, The Lions Den, with Austin Nops of The Effens mixing and mastering at Lootbag Studios. JONCRO released the <em>Lions Den Session</em> live set in December of 2020, having issued the multifaceted EP <em>The Joncro Mountains</em> just a few months prior.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2532552852/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://joncro.bandcamp.com/track/passa-passa-4">Passa Passa by JONCRO</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=fiver_with_the_atlantic_school_of_spontaneous_composition><span class=artist-title><a href="https://fiverforreal.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Fiver with the Atlantic School Of Spontaneous Composition</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Learning Hard (On My Peripheral Vision)&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://fiverforreal.bandcamp.com/track/leaning-hard-on-my-peripheral-vision" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Simone Schmidt&#39;s solo venture <a href="http://www.fiverfiverfiver.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fiver</a> returns this spring with the proper follow-up to 2017&#39;s lauded <em>Audible Songs From Rockwood</em>. The new record carries the title <em>Fiver with the Atlantic School Of Spontaneous Composition</em>, referencing the team of improvisational maritime musicians Schmidt wrote and recorded with throughout 2017 and 2018. Those players include <a href="https://budi.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nick Dourado</a> (<a href="https://aquakultre.d]bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Aquakultre</a>, <a href="https://centuryegg.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Century Egg</a>), <a href="https://specialcostello.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Special Costello</a>&#39;s Jeremy Costello, and <a href="http://vulvaculture.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Vulva Culture</a>&#39;s Bianca Palmer. The Nova Scotian trio&#39;s notably collaborated with <a href="https://www.songcycles.com/" class="" target=_blank>Beverly Glenn-Copeland</a> in recent years. In a press-release, label <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> touts the project as delivering no less than &quot;an unexpected reimagining of Country music and its possibilities.&quot;</p><p>You can stream the record&#39;s lead single, &quot;Learning Hard (On My Peripheral Vision)&quot; at Bandcamp now (and while you&#39;re there - the liner notes provide an extraordinarily detailed dive into each of the records&#39; 8 songs - of which &quot;Peripheral Vision&quot; may be the most conventional). This set marks Schmidt&#39;s second outing with the Atlantic School, following the <em>You Wanted Country?</em> EP from April of last year.</p><p>With this record, Simone Schmidt has seven full-lengths under her belt.

The group commented on the heady tune in a press release, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#39;s about a person who is losing touch with reality. Who thinks he has a higher purpose and is supposed to be an ambassador to a higher extraterrestrial race. It&#39;s a looming atmospheric rhythm and crawl.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song arrives alongside a video from director Justin Cober, who detailed the visuals:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In an attempt to achieve a higher purpose in life, the subject instead witnesses their own deteriorating mental posture. As a means of overcoming assumed existential risk (the hurdles of our great filter), the subject looks above and within believing that they alone have been chosen to solve the problems that our species faces. Images of Eva Szasz&#39; 1968 short film &#39;Cosmic Zoom&#39;, produced by the National Film Board of Canada were cast over foliage to make for fitting imagery, complementing the narrative.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Yoo Doo Right recorded <em>Don&#39;t Think You Can Escape Your Purpose</em> in Quebec City and Montreal, working with Sebastien Fournier (Panopticon Eyelids, No Negative) at Hotel2Tango and Guillaume Chiasson (Ponctuation, Jesuslesfilles) at Le Pantoum. The band features the talents of Justin Cober (guitar, synthesizers, vocals), Charles Masson (bass), and John Talbot (drums, percussion). With a pair of earlier EPs under their belt, the trio most recently released a split 7&quot; with Japanese psych titans Acid Mothers Temple. A track collaborating with Ottawa vocalist <a href="https://jasminetrailsss.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Jasmine Trails</a> also recently appeared on Mothland&#39;s <em>Sounds From Mothland</em> mixtape.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gy3UjGBLdMU" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h3 id=slurry><span class=artist-title><a href="https://sistersuzie780.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Slurry</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Panic&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://slurryslurry.bandcamp.com/track/panic" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto alt-pop group <a href="https://slurryslurry.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Slurry</a> has a wild new track online titled &quot;Panic.&quot; Fans of the contemporary No Wave group Luge should find a lot to love here, as &quot;Panic&quot; plays with form and tempo in a fashion not dissimilar to that group&#39;s recent work.</p><p>Slurry features Rachel Bellone, Steven LourenÃ§o, Pat McKenna, and Steven Conway.

Last week the band unveiled the second track on the EP, with &quot;Act Two&quot; clocking in at a whopping twenty-six minutes. The song finds the band in an astonishingly playful mood, hoping genres a dozen times over the extended runtime (including a swing at around 11 minutes that would fit right in on the soundtrack of an old spaghetti western). Nothing else sounds like this.</p><p><em>I&#39;ll save you some precious inbox space and avoid reiterating the whole <a href="https://www.someparty.ca/2021-02-07-year-of-the-horse/#fucked_up" class="" target=_blank>zodiac</a> story here, but hop back a few weeks into the archives if you need a refresher.</em></p><p>&quot;Act Two&quot; primarily feature studio instrumentation from Mike Haliechuk and Jonah Falco (vibraphone, trumpets, and whistling included).

The record features ten credited players recorded at the storied <a href="http://www.hotel2tango.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hotel2Tango</a> studio.

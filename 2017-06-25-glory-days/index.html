Los Angeles punk label <a href="https://sideonedummy.com/" class="" target=_blank>SideOneDummy Records</a> tweeted out an animated GIF of Ralph Wiggum sporting the Red Serge and playing the role of Canada at a Simpsons model UN. They had something Canadian to announce. Toronto&#39;s <a href="http://www.puptheband.com/" class="" target=_blank>PUP</a>, who&#39;d broken into the the US punk scene on the label a few years ago, dropped hints as well. <a href="https://www.pkewx3.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pkew Pkew Pkew</a>, the Toronto party-punk act whose repertoire largely (and proudly) consists of songs about beer and pizza, was getting the call up to the punk rock big leagues.</p><p>It&#39;s fascinating to look at this transition from this side of the border and compare it to the PR push. You&#39;re of course elated that someone from the home team is getting a shot at making their band their day job. Of course a goofy punk act with a bizarre name like Pkew Pkew Pkew&#39;s never going to sell out arenas, but this type of arrangement could absolutely keep them with a full tour calendar for the near future. You&#39;ve also got that tinge of jealous regret that you&#39;re probably never going to see the band play to 20 people on the floor of Patrick Sheehan&#39;s Irish Pub ever again. Those days are numbered.</p><p>My main reaction to these signings, be it Pkew or PUP or The Dirty Nil, is it makes me feel for how damn exhausting the journey must have been. When I first saw Pkew Pkew Pkew it was as part of the now-defunct S.C.E.N.E. Music Festival, playing that graveyard shift of a noon set at an all day event. The infectious pop-punk songs they were belting out in 2011 (&quot;Asshole Pandemic,&quot; &quot;Stop Calling Us Chief&quot;, et al) would later appear on a 7&quot; here or there, eventually on the 2013 <em>Glory Days</em> album (which was I think retroactively downgraded to an EP), and later on their proper debut for <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain</a>. Now those songs are again getting a reprieve on this SideOne debut. This band has had to, likely many times in the years between now and then, make a choice to not settle for whatever level of exposure these dumb little drinking songs had achieved. For a group that seems so irreverent and carefree, there&#39;s been a long slog behind the scenes to get from there to here. I&#39;m so happy for them, but to consider the years it took and how much songwriting may have been on hold for the sake of <em>these</em> songs... it just leaves me exhausted.</p><p>If SideOne can be guaranteed of anything, it&#39;s that Pkew Pkew Pkew are no strangers to hard work or taking the long view (so long as they can drink on the job, I guess).</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=1280 height=720 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYzGVz0sX60?rel=0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><h2 class=generic>Steel City</span></h2><p>Hamilton three-piece garage-punk act <a href="https://fleshrag.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Flesh Rag</a> (members of Hamilton&#39;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teeveefreakzz/" class="" target=_blank>TV Freaks</a> and Welland&#39;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Rocket-Reducers-50250806853/" class="" target=_blank>Rocket Reducers</a>) is touring this summer, heading to the Maritimes and back in the first few weeks of July, including an appearance at Moncton&#39;s three day <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/210827159409117/" class="" target=_blank>NO Funswick Fest</a> on the 7th.

What do I get from the Tourism Moncton if I mention the city a third time in this week&#39;s letter? The label boldly states that Cheap Wine &quot;sound like classic 70s punk always sounds in your head, but somehow never quite lives up to&quot; and while I&#39;m not sure what that means, I&#39;m down. You can check out the cover art and some pressing info at the label. There&#39;s no music available to share yet.</p><p><a href="https://singlemothersband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Single Mothers</a>&#39; new, Wade MacNeil produced LP <em>Our Pleasure</em> was released last week. It&#39;s snide, self-depreciating, and is, from what I can see, being pretty well received. In support of the record there&#39;s an overseas tour lined up for the fall that will see the band playing shows in the UK and mainland Europe. You can find the tour dates over at <a href="http://www.upsetmagazine.com/news/single-mothers-announce-november-headline-tour/" class="" target=_blank>Upset</a>. A video for the song &quot;People are Pets&quot; also arrived this week. I&#39;ll share it here, although I&#39;m strongly considering a Some Party lyric video boycott, just on principle.

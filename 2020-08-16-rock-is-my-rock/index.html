The Sackville-bred group returns on November 20 with <em>Never Give Up</em>, a 10-song album and the proper follow-up to 2017&#39;s Polaris-shortlisted <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>. This record finds vocalist/guitarist Josée Caron and vocalist/bassist Lucy Niles backed by the well-regarded Toronto drummer Simone TB (Darlene Shrugg, Fake Palms). Among the album&#39;s runtime, you&#39;ll find the group&#39;s recent Rush-inspired single &quot;Good Place To Hide (At The Time)&quot; along with the newly available, album-opening pair &quot;Hello and Welcome&quot; and &quot;Rock is My Rock.&quot; All evidence points to the group diving head-first into their classic rock influences this time out, both in sound and sentiment. The group commented on the new tracks:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Hello and Welcome&#39; is the opening track to our upcoming full-length album, <em>Never Give Up</em>. In this song, we will take you on a journey and introduce you to the new universe we are exploring on this album. We are very thrilled to have collaborated with Dustin Apodaca (Midnight Peacemaker) for this exciting music video.</p><p>&#39;Rock Is My Rock&#39; is a song that we wrote to celebrate the joy of rock, and the joy it brings us to see other people feel the joy of rock. We wanted to thank the music for bringing us happiness and keeping us company during difficult times. This song is dedicated to anyone for whom rock is a rock. We know 2020 has been a different kind of year for everyone. There has been a lot of stress but also a lot of good with positive change happening in our society, whether it&#39;s baby steps or great leaps. We just want to thank everyone who has bought our record, or listened to a Partner tune and enjoyed it. We appreciate all of the support in every way. We can&#39;t wait to be able to see you all in person again.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Partner recorded this material in July of 2019 at Palace Sounds, with Steve Chahley (Ice Cream, US Girls) engineering. The group last released the <em>Saturday the 14th</em> EP in 2019. <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> has <em>Never Give Up</em> on deck for a November 20 release, plenty of time to get your KISS boots polished.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjpeQ0h1LH0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/HjpeQ0h1LH0" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Partner - &quot;Hello and Welcome&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W4q9EDP9eJ4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/W4q9EDP9eJ4" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Partner - &quot;Rock Is My Rock&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>After a seemingly impossible run of unannounced quarantine releases, it looks like Welland&#39;s <a href="https://www.danielromanomusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Daniel Romano</a> is returning the normal album cycle. A September 18 release date&#39;s locked in for his next proper full-length, <em>How Ill Thy World Is Ordered</em>. Properly attributed to Daniel Romano&#39;s Outfit, the project features Danny&#39;s full touring band, currently comprised of vocalist Julianna Riolino, guitarist/vocalist David Nardi, bassist Roddy Rossetti, and drummer Ian Romano. The 11-song set builds upon that core group with contributions from pianist Mark Lalama, vocalist Briana Salmena, sax player Victor Belcastro, and Aaron Hutchinson on trumpet. The write-up from <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> suggests a guitar-forward rock record, claiming more &quot;honest-to-the-core lead guitar playing than Daniel has previously committed to tape.&quot; The press release continues:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The band assembled in studio in a perfectly tuned geometry to record these new songs following simple guidelines and simple rules: play the whole thing, in sequence, 3 takes or bust, with no overdubs; play &#39;the sound of the feel of a snake bite;&#39; play &#39;a heist on horseback for fool&#39;s gold.&#39;&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The album-opening single &quot;A Rat Without a Tale&quot; is now streaming online, with an accompanying video running at the usual outlets.</p><p><em>How Ill Thy World Is Ordered</em> clocks in as the 9th fully-realized release from Romano this calendar year, but only the second to earn a physical presence (following March&#39;s live record, <em>&quot;Okay Wow&quot;</em>). Since the pandemic took hold, Danny&#39;s shared the original full-lengths <em>Dandelion</em>, <em>Content To Point The Way</em>, and <em>&quot;Visions Of The Higher Dream&quot;</em>, along with a high-concept front-to-back cover of Bob Dylan&#39;s <em>Infidels</em>. He co-created <em>A Splendour Of Heart</em> backing Ottawa vocalist <a href="https://www.kellysloan.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Kelly Sloan</a>, the punk record <em>Spider Bite</em> with Constantines&#39; <a href="http://stevenlambke.com/" class="" target=_blank>Steven Lambke</a>, the spirited <em>Super Pollen</em> EP with members of <a href="http://fuckedup.cc/" class="" target=_blank>Fucked Up</a>, and the 23-minute prog single &quot;Forever Love&#39;s Fool&quot; (featuring the Tool drummer Daniel Carey, of all people).</p><p>One assumes that with an actual pre-announced record on the horizon, that could be it for a while, but without the ability to tour, I suspect we&#39;ll hear more from Romano&#39;s restless home studio sooner than later.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X-zQ-_F0Yb0" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/X-zQ-_F0Yb0" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Daniel Romano&#39;s Outfit - &quot;A Rat Without a Tale&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto&#39;s ever-evolving garage-punks <a href="https://teenanger.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Teenanger</a> recently shared their second preview of <em>Good Time</em> in the form of the provincially-minded &quot;Trillium Song.&quot; The high-strung track features the always wry vocals of Chris Swimmings, with bassist Melissa Ball joining in for the chorus. Swimmings commented on the song&#39;s subject matter in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song is about the province of Ontario where we all reside. Mainly about the current provincial government&#39;s way of dealing with the education system and the environment. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Premier Doug Ford (the song&#39;s primary subject) was making good headway at polishing his public image by being hands-on. He made promises of people not losing their jobs and tenants not being evicted. They were timely promises in the beginning as we are now seeing many tenants in Ontario face eviction due to not being able to make ends meet in the pandemic.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Good Time</em> arrives October 2 as Teenanger&#39;s sixth full-length, once again via the band&#39;s longtime label <a href="https://www.telephoneexplosion.com/" class="" target=_blank>Telephone Explosion</a>.

The band recently revealed that their forthcoming <a href="https://weareblackbox.com/" class="" target=_blank>Black Box</a> LP would be titled <em>The Ends</em>, and comes with an October 30 release date. The 10-song set includes the earlier singles &quot;Cash&quot; and &quot;Not Again,&quot; as well as the newly unveiled &quot;Fight Song.&quot; That track arrived alongside both a new video and high-profile write up in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/y3ze3j/the-obgms-need-to-be-torontos-next-big-punk-band" class="" target=_blank>Vice</a>. The OBGMs hyperbolic self-promotion (they regularly declare that they <em>are</em> Nirvana) seems to be paying off.</p><p>The OBGMs play as a trio comprised of guitarist/vocalist Densil McFarlane, bassist Joseph Brosnan, and drummer Colanthony Humphrey. They recorded this new material with Grammy and JUNO Award-winning producer Dave Schiffman (PUP, The Bronx, Anti-Flag).</p><p>Upon the release of their prior single, I had a brief but illuminating chat with McFarlane on the band&#39;s high-octane garage-punk sound, their in-your-face promotional strategy, BIPOC rock representation, and more.

While they&#39;ve yet to elaborate on the sentiment implied in the title, the brash new single &quot;Doom Boy&quot; may offer a few hints. The track finds the band fusing their familiar brand of hooky power-pop with a gleeful dose of thrash metal riffing. An accompanying video sees the group exuberantly leaning into low-brow metal tropes and a late-80s VHS aesthetic. Frequent Nil collaborators Mitch Barnes and Victor Malang returned to direct the clip. Frontman Luke Bentham commented on the experience:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Without parallel, &#39;Doom Boy&#39; is the most dangerous video we&#39;ve ever made. When we were told that all we had to do was return the shell of the van to get half our money back, all hell broke loose. Between the Roman candles, vintage mini bikes and minivan mayhem, I was quite surprised that we only had a few injuries by the end of the night. Do NOT attempt any of the antics performed in the &#39;Doom Boy&#39; video. You&#39;ve been warned.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Doom Boy&quot; follows the group&#39;s recent &quot;Done With Drugs&quot; single, with both expected on <em>Fuck Art</em> when it arrives on <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a> later this year.</p><p>As reported earlier, Bentham, bassist Ross Miller, and drummer Kyle Fisher benefited from living together under the same roof throughout the COVID quarantine. That arrangement allowed the group to forge ahead on this record without having to resort to clumsy remote setups or precautionary distancing.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGnyf52WZds" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/LGnyf52WZds" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: The Dirty Nil - &quot;Doom Boy&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Speaking of Ross Millar, the musician&#39;s posi-hardcore solo project <a href="http://whenimove.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>When I Move</a> recently shared a new single.

This week the trio shared a video for the propulsive &quot;Hail Taxi,&quot; a song world&#39;s more aggressive than the shoegaze-flavoured first single, &quot;A Boat to Drown In.&quot; Frontman Alex Edkins commented on the track in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Hail Taxi&#39; is about looking back. The lyrics deal with the idea of reconciling or coming to terms with who you were and who you&#39;ve become.</p></blockquote><p>A.F. Cortes directed the &quot;Hail Taxi&quot; video, which can be found now on YouTube. The filmmaker explained:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I wanted to tell a simple story that captures the song&#39;s overarching theme. The idea of longing for the past creates many visual motifs and I wanted to create a piece that feels timeless and conveys a sense of isolation, highlighting that while we can hide our feelings, we can&#39;t run from them.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Atlas Vending</em> arrives on October 9 from <a href="https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Royal Mountain Records</a> and <a href="https://www.subpop.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sub Pop</a>.

In between their previous LP, the Steve Albini engineered <em>Strange Peace</em>, and this record, METZ released a b-sides and rarities collection for Sub Pop titled <em>Automat</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRK05iTxfo4" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/QRK05iTxfo4" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: METZ - &quot;Hail Taxi&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://youngguv.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Young Guv</a> shared a new single this week titled &quot;Cold In The Summer,&quot; with proceeds from the track to be donated to the <a href="https://indigenousyouth.org/" class="" target=_blank>International Indigenous Youth Council</a>&#39;s <a href="https://donorbox.org/iiyc-covid-19-fund" class="" target=_blank>Southwest COVID-19 Emergency Response</a>.

It&#39;s a 6x6&quot; art postcard accompanied by 16 MP3 tracks recorded by telephone from March through June of 2020, and if you listen very closely you can hear diverse artists with either high-volume pre-lockdown mania, isolated quarantine loner expressions, or the jubilance that comes with the possibility of post-emergency liberation. The full early-COVID narrative is there, waiting for you to relive through audio hallucination. File under independent DIY punk, pop, experimental, bloops, bleeps, feeling and solitude.

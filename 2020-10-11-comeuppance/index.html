His new solo endeavour, which goes by the name of Careful, appears to state otherwise. The project&#39;s first single, released through Portland&#39;s <a href="https://drunkdialrecords.bandcamp.com/album/drunk-dial-7-careful" class="" target=_blank>Drunk Dial Records</a>, features the original &quot;Comeuppance&quot; backed with a cover of &quot;Ingrown,&quot; originally by the Australian alternative legends Smudge. In a lengthy statement which accompanied the <a href="https://thebadcopy.com/news/stream/dave-williams-crusades-steve-adamyk-band-premieres-new-solo-7/" class="" target=_blank>premiere</a>, Williams eulogized his past while charting this next course:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I truly mourned the loss of CRUSADES. But it wasn&#39;t just the band. My sorrow was deeper than any one band or scene. I came to realize that it was the kind of deep-seated sadness that could only be managed by regular unpacking and exploration. And the one thing I couldn&#39;t do was hide it away. Covering it up wasn&#39;t an option.</p><p>And therein lies the impetus for CAREFUL: an outlet, still within my chosen musical community and family, for the core ideas and events and beliefs that shaped and continue to shape me, for the sake of my own mental health and conveyed by what I hope is a universal-enough approach that it can possibly help and/or inspire others as well.</p><p>Musically, I&#39;m reaching back to the early-to-mid 90s, before I became completely entrenched in the self-imposed confines of hardcore and punk rock, to the bands that eventually led me there: The Lemonheads, Juliana Hatfield, Dinosaur Jr, Doughboys, The Killjoys, Punchbuggy, etc: the first bands that felt like they were ours and not just our parents&#39; music.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can read Williams&#39; full statement, which grapples further with his place in the music scene post-Crusades, at <a href="https://thebadcopy.com/news/stream/dave-williams-crusades-steve-adamyk-band-premieres-new-solo-7/" class="" target=_blank>The Bad Copy</a>.</p><p>Dave Williams recently released an 8-song full-length as part of the synth-pop duo <a href="https://surrendersounds.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Surrender</a>, paired with fellow Crusades&#39; alum Scott McCash.

Like the previous EP, these four songs find Cabot recording directly to a laptop&#39;s internal mic, with the limitations of his basement setup embuing the tracks with a tossed-off sense of spontaneity that never feels like a detriment.</p><p>While this set of tunes focuses a little bit less on the farcical cause of Boularderie Island independence, I think it&#39;s safe to assume the revolution&#39;s never far from Cabot&#39;s heart.

A press-release detailed the four-song set:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>There&#39;s No Such Luck</em> was honed in Rivers&#39; home, the Dissonant Folk Factory in Guelph, with producer Zach &quot;JEB the QB&quot; Kadey. Featuring primarily drum machine, plunky synth, and acoustic guitar, plus harmonies from Katie Lammert and pedal steel from Aaron Goldstein, <em>There&#39;s No Such Luck</em> is Rivers&#39; ode to the twee-pop and twee-folk records they came to love from Pink Couch Sessions and late-night Soulseek binges in their late teens and early twenties. The EP pirouettes between sunshine and storm clouds, flickers like moonbeams through a night fog, bops like a worn out skip rope soundtrack cassette tape. There&#39;s no such luck, such wrecks as us.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can preview the single &quot;All The Rage&quot; below.

The artist commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;There was a really distinct, yet indescribable, texture that seemed to be thick in the air, and that&#39;s exactly what I wanted to try and translate through &#39;Sparkle &amp; Bleed.&#39; No one knew what to make of it at all, we were just floating and lost. It&#39;s those feelings, that words have no ability to communicate, where music has the job of stepping in and taking over.</p><p>The shutdown in the spring brought with it a constant, ominous grey that covered the southern Ontario sky. The windows of bars, shops, restaurants and convenience stores were all replaced by sheets of plywood. It was bitterly cold and there was a confusion and uncertainty that was thick in the air.</p><p>Despite it only being less than a year ago, it seems like a lifetime in the past now, as all the other otherworldly events of 2020 followed shortly after. &#39;Sparkle &amp; Bleed&#39; is an attempt to journalistically capture this drastic and dramatic change, which came with a feeling of everlasting permanence in what was really only a few short weeks of our lives.</p></blockquote><p>The track features McGrath on keys, guitar, bass, and vocals, with Connor Ellinger on drums and Darrek Anderson on pedal steel. New Brunswick&#39;s <a href="https://juliedoiron.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Julie Doiron</a> appears as a vocalist on the track (McGrath was notably a member of Doiron&#39;s punk-flavoured 2017 group <a href="https://julieandthewrongguys.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Julie &amp; The Wrong Guys</a>).

Down, down, down you pathetically slide until you reach the bottom. Finally, you find yourself hanging from the cliffs of sanity, above the fiery hell of romance. We present to you &#39;Blunt Force Concussion...&#39; We pulled out all the stops on this one: bangin&#39; ass drum fills, booty shakin&#39; bass lines, big boi geetars and a thousand dollar chorus. If you don&#39;t like this song, fuck you and the horse you rode in on.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new tune follows &quot;Done With Drugs&quot; and &quot;Doom Boy&quot; in previewing the record, the band&#39;s third. The album is due from <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a> on January 1, 2021. The trio, featuring Bentham on guitar and vocals backed by bassist Ross Miller, and drummer Kyle Fisher, is following-up on their 2018 <em>Master Volume</em>.</p><p>The band is currently in the midst of a 14-day live streaming event, featuring the Nil and a revolving cast of musicians appearing virtually in concert with venues across North America.

The song arrived alongside a video comprised of Super 8 camera footage filmed by Vanessa Heins. Burton commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Vanessa accompanied me on a drive down to Nashville in the fall of 2019 where I was to be recording at Andrija Tokic&#39;s studio named The Bomb Shelter, She took shots of me at various stops during moments of interest or beauty. It&#39;s crazy the things one can get up to on a 13 hour drive... we&#39;re losing the things that matter. Our small towns, and with them the memories we&#39;ve created here. No Sunday drive reminders if there&#39;s nowhere to drive but the mall. On a weekly basis, I see old homes torn down for mansions, corn fields removed for subdivisions, and small businesses washed away for big box stores. It&#39;s a sad thing to see. A most unwelcome change.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new song, along with the preceding single &quot;Further,&quot; follows <em>The Mountain Man</em>, an album of children&#39;s songs the rural-minded Burton issued last year. The tracks also follow-up his 2017 full-length <em>Songs Of</em>.</p><p>While he&#39;s several albums into a solo career writing rustic country and clever folk tunes, Burton&#39;s roots were in the much-loved Welland pop-punk band <a href="https://attackinblack.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Attack In Black</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KXiiuagS2M" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/4KXiiuagS2M" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Spencer Burton - &quot;Memories We Won&#39;t Soon Forget&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Beloved Calgarian indie-folk mutant <a href="https://chadvangaalen.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chad VanGaalen</a> has a new b-sides collection online. <em>Lost Harmonies</em> features largely improvisational synth-focused music intended for a shelved record titled <em>Lost Harmony</em>. The artist commented on the project:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I was always critical of the way my voice still sounded like my normal voice, and the album got shelved. Eventually I returned to it and tried manipulating the sounds using pitch-shifting and changing tape speeds. I finally felt like it was cool to drool, and it evolved into <em>Lost Harmonies</em>... These are the kind of songs I make to entertain myself late at night.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The set marks VanGaalen&#39;s second collection of b-sides for the pandemic era, following the <em>Odds &amp; Sods 2</em> set from March.

On paper, summer may extend well into September, but I don&#39;t believe it. It doesn&#39;t feel like it. I can&#39;t shake the rhythms of high school, no matter how far I lumber into adulthood. The fun may not be over, but I can feel the weight of responsibility creeping up over the horizon. Expectations loom. Sharpen your pencils. Submit to the relentless march to normalcy.</p><p>The last day of this particular August brings with it <em>14 Lashes</em>, the debut full length from Vancouver punks <a href="https://chainwhip.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Chain Whip</a>, and it violently rejects that premise. <em>14 Lashes</em> doesn&#39;t just push back against the late-summer doldrums, it thrashes. It careens. It rejects the coming drudgery at a speed that&#39;s just fucking irresponsible.</p><p><em>14 Lashes</em> finds Chain Whip dumping the toybox of 80s hardcore to create a glorious mess that couples the speed of California&#39;s pioneers with the sneering fight of the UK scene. The band features Josh Nickel of the recently defunct <a href="https://fashionism.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Fashionism</a> on vocals, Joel Butler of <a href="https://nervoustalk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Nervous Talk</a> and the Corner Boys on guitar, Brett Thompson of <a href="https://stresseating.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Stress Eating</a> on bass, and Patrick Bertrand of <a href="https://cornerboys.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Corner Boys</a> on drums. Nickel and Bertrand respectively run <a href="https://neontasterecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Neon Taste</a> and <a href="https://hoseheadrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Hosehead Records</a>, and their efforts championing the sound and style of classic punk rock have been tireless. That love of the genre and its history bleeds through to this band, but there&#39;s no nostalgia here. Chain Whip is simply too <em>alive</em> to be discounted as a tribute act.</p><p>Last week Some Party ran one of the final previews of <em>14 Lashes</em> before it hits the streets, the blazing fast &quot;Crawlspace Boyfriend&quot; (all 58 seconds thereof). Here&#39;s what Josh had this to say about the track:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I read a news story about a 14-year-old girl that had her 20 something-year-old boyfriend living in the attic of her parents&#39; house. I figured the only thing creepier was if you had your own stalker living in your attic and had no idea. Is it a real threat? Play the housing crisis out to its logical conclusion, and let&#39;s see I guess.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In fact, you can now preview the entire record now at <a href="https://chainwhip.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a>. <em>14 Lashes</em> arrives digitally on August 31, with the band pressing vinyl themselves through their Chain Whip Records imprint and <a href="https://sabotagerecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Sabotage Records</a> handling the European release. In North America, you can snag a copy through the <a href="https://www.neontasterecords.ca" class="" target=_blank>Neon Taste</a> store.</p><p>The band will launch <em>14 Lashes</em> with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2634630263216893/" class="" target=_blank>release party</a> at Vancouver&#39;s SBC Restaurant on Saturday, August 31. Kamloops&#39; <a href="https://boot-licker.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Bootlicker</a> (for whom Josh now plays second guitar), Edmonton&#39;s <a href="https://creepingchill.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Creeping Chill</a>, and the new Chilliwack group Cheat (members of <a href="https://nicfitvan.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Nic Fit</a>) will join them.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width="100%" height=300 scrolling=no frameborder=no allow=autoplay data-src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/669743429%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-vNVYx&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" class=lazyload></iframe> </body></html> </div><p><a href="https://www.someparty.ca/premieres/chain-whip-crawlspace-boyfriend/" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Listen: Chain Whip - &quot;Crawlspace Boyfriend&quot; @ Some Party</a></p><p>Last week also saw the Vancouver-bred indie-pop supergroup <a href="http://www.thenewpornographers.com/" class="" target=_blank>The New Pornographers</a> share another song from their upcoming record. &quot;The Surprise Knock&quot; is the second taste we&#39;ve had of <em>In The Morse Code Of Brake Lights</em>, following the single &quot;Falling Down the Stairs of Your Smile&quot; earlier this month. The new 11-song LP will be the band&#39;s eighth, following 2017&#39;s <em>Whiteout Conditions</em>.</p><p>Frontman <a href="https://www.acnewman.net/" class="" target=_blank>AC Newman</a> had this to say about the track, which harkens back to some of the band&#39;s scrappier early work:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;The Surprise Knock&#39; had a different feel when we first recorded it—and I wouldn&#39;t mind releasing that version at some point. But as I was listening to it, I thought, &#39;Why don&#39;t we play this song like New Pornographers 2005?&#39; Then we just replayed it with that feel. I thought enough time has passed that I feel like I can play songs that sort of sound like a classic a sound and not feel like I&#39;m repeating myself, because it&#39;s been so long. That was definitely a part of it: just wanting to... I hate to say &#39;get back,&#39; but just get more slightly raucous and sounding more like a band.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>In The Morse Code Of Brake Lights</em> is due September 27 from <a href="https://www.collectedworksrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Collected Works Records</a> and <a href="https://concord.com/" class="" target=_blank>Concord</a>.</p><p>Among their upcoming tour dates, the New Pornographers will be headlining the Friday night main stage of <a href="https://beaus.ca/" class="" target=_blank>Beau&#39;s</a> <a href="https://www.beausoktoberfest.ca" class="" target=_blank>Oktoberfest</a>. That festival/fundraiser runs September 20 and 21 in the craft brewery&#39;s rural hometown of Vankleek Hill, Ontario. Toronto rapper <a href="https://www.shadk.com/" class="" target=_blank>Shad</a> will top that same stage on Saturday evening to close the event. Every year Oktoberfest also features the punk-and-skate oriented Black Forest stage, with <a href="https://thepenskefileband.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Penske File</a>, <a href="https://lostlove.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lost Love</a>, <a href="http://joncreeden.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Flying Hellfish</a>, <a href="https://palelips.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Pale Lips</a>, and <a href="https://mobinagalore.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mobina Galore</a> among the 2019 performers.

Based in Montreal, Woods had been performing similar material in recent years alongside singer-songwriter <a href="http://basiabulat.com/" class="" target=_blank>Basia Bulat</a> under the name Napster Vertigo. One has to assume that whoever holds the trademark to the long-dead file sharing service wasn&#39;t entirely hip to that, hence the change. (As a side-note, it&#39;s also worth digging into some of the early Napster Vertigo <a href="https://exclaim.ca/music/article/alvvays_napster_vertigo-mod_club_theatre_toronto_on_december_12" class="" target=_blank>show reviews</a>, as the band&#39;s stage antics tell you something about their approach to this material).</p><p>Last week Exclaim premiered Legal Vertigo&#39;s mock-infomercial video for &quot;At The Brasserie,&quot; a track written in tribute to the Montreal venue <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brasseriebeaubien/" class="" target=_blank>Brasserie Beaubien</a>. Woods spoke to <a href="https://exclaim.ca/music/article/join_legal_vertigo_at_the_brasserie_in_his_new_video" class="" target=_blank>Exclaim</a>, commenting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The Brasserie Beaubien is part of an accidental evolution. It used to be where Hell&#39;s Angels, Legionnaires, and neighbourhood locals would go to unwind, scheme, fight, and find love (etc.). Circumstance has mysterious&#39; intentions.&#39; In this case, as in many others (in many other cities) a place that once thrived for some has begun to thrive for others.</p><p>In this particular case, the former biker bar has become the hub of a thriving local arts scene with aspiring rock bands, comedians, drag dancers, poets, singer-songwriters, and seemingly anyone who wants to be on a stage (special thanks to Annie, James, &amp; Julian). It is an institution of Montreal where major promoters sometimes put on events and &#39;successful&#39; acts throw surprise events or try out new material. And let&#39;s not forget, of course, the typical weekday show with unmade artists, weirdos and outlaws...</p></blockquote><p><em>Tragic Future Film Star</em> arrives on November 15. While Woods may have first shown up your radar a few years back as a member of the Charlottetown indie rock group <a href="https://boxerthehorse.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Boxter The Horse</a>. He recently served as co-producer on <em>Radiant Dawn</em>, the recent full-length from Dan Boeckner&#39;s <a href="http://operatorsmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>Operators</a>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uK45uJFyQjw" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/uK45uJFyQjw" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Legal Vertigo - &quot;At The Brasserie&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Power-pop/pop-punk act <a href="http://www.prettymatty.com" class="" target=_blank>Pretty Matty</a>, the recording project fronted by Toronto&#39;s Matty Morand, has a new song online titled &quot;I&#39;m Fine.&quot; It&#39;s another preview of the band&#39;s upcoming self-titled full length, due this September from on cassette from <a href="https://getbetterrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Get Better Records</a>. Morand spoke to <a href="https://exclaim.ca/music/article/pretty_matty_swears_im_fine_in_new_single" class="" target=_blank>Exclaim</a> about the track, commenting:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;I&#39;m Fine&#39; is &quot;the closest I had ever come to writing a straight-up love song.

Volume four of the set finds the trio tackling Big Star&#39;s 1974 single &quot;September Gurls&quot; (entirely fitting for a band that so clearly worships Alex Chilton). It&#39;s paired with a thunderous take on &quot;Without You,&quot; the Badfinger-penned classic that became massive a massive hit for Harry Neilson in 1972 (and again for Mariah Carey in 1994).</p><p>The prior installments of the series featured charged up takes on Van Halen, April Wine, Culture Abuse, The Jesus and Mary Chain, David Bowie, and The Who. Frontman Luke Bentham boasted in the latest press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We can say with complete honesty that we saved the best for last... trimmed down and dimed up!&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The Big Star cover first surfaced on what could best be described as stunt-merch, an ultra-limited 2018 <a href="https://www.discogs.com/The-Dirty-Nil-Youre-Welcome/release/12846772" class="" target=_blank>8-track</a> of which 15 were ever made.

From that set, the group recently released the single &quot;Save Me.&quot; It, like much of the band&#39;s recent studio work, was produced by Sune Rose Wagner of the long-running Danish rock group The Raveonettes. Vocalist/keyboardist Michelle Opthof commented on the politically-charged track, which the band had set out to write as a punk song:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#39;s about people exerting control because they think they&#39;re better, that they&#39;re superior to someone else. It&#39;s two ideas: the religious side of things says you can save them all but at the same time we look at it saying you actually cannot save them all, meaning you cannot save them from themselves. And for myself I grew up in an environment governed by a very strict church, that has its own school system and completely controls everyone&#39;s lives, including what they are to think and believe</p><p>In our own history the Europeans came here and thought they could control and convert all the indigenous people and how they thought they were so much better. But there&#39;s another, deeper layer to the song where I came to the conclusion that you can&#39;t save everyone, you can&#39;t win every battle, and that for your own peace of mind, to avoid being overwhelmed and despairing, sometimes you have to just admit that you can&#39;t save them all.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Paragon Cause features Opthof and guitarist/songwriter Jay Bonaparte. <em>Lies Between Us</em> will be the first in a series of releases leading up to a full-length in 2020.</p><div class=media-wrapper><div class=aspect-ratio><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe width=560 height=315 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-f2RPT2VrKg" class="aspect-ratio--object lazyload"></iframe> </body></html> </div></div><p><a href="https://youtu.be/-f2RPT2VrKg" class=legacy-media-link target=_blank>Watch: Paragon Cause - &quot;Save Me&quot; @ YouTube</a></p><p>Last week the Kitchener/Waterloo-based punk group <a href="http://fatherbodies.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Father Bodies</a> released a new 5-song EP titled <em>One Step Behind</em>.

That set will feature the upbeat single &quot;Lighten Up,&quot; which you can check out now in a new clip at YouTube. The band shot the video while on tour in Taiwan, combining live footage with more candid shots from their travels. Bassist Fred Yurichuk commented on the production:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We were travelling on a shoestring budget, and I brought one of my cameras along. We shot everything: when we were on the train, when we hired a driver, when we were in our backpackers&#39; hostel the camera was rolling all the time. At shows, we would find someone to hold the camera or put it on a tripod. When we got home, we had this whole mountain of footage and just sifted through it and thought it was a great idea.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Neon Bloom features lead vocalist Jen Simpson (of the late-2000s Toronto punk quartet <a href="http://misadventuresofmachetes.blogspot.com/" class="" target=_blank>Machetes</a>), Yurichuk (of the experimental <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Girl-The-Machine-75305801869/" class="" target=_blank>Girl + the Machine</a>) on bass and guitar, guitarist/keyboardist Simon Chow, and drummer/keyboardist Chris Romano.

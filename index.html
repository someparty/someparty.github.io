I&#39;m not even referring to this newsletter overshooting its deadline by a whole month (although I am nodding at that). I&#39;m talking about the six years which have allegedly passed since the last <a href="https://shotgunjimmie.net/" class="" target=_blank>Shotgun Jimmie</a> record. I&#39;m skeptical.</p><p>The pandemic fucked with our collective sense of continuity, but even taking that into account, I can&#39;t acknowledge that it&#39;s been so long. <a href="https://jimmiekilpatrick.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Jimmie Kilpatrick</a> doesn&#39;t fit the usual narrative - the ebb-and-flow of album cycles and band activity. Jim&#39;s songs boast the kind of muscle-memory familiarity you&#39;d reserve for an old friend, picking up right where you left off. Has it been six years since we last spoke? I don&#39;t believe it. Jim&#39;s never left.</p><p>That known quality could cut both ways. Will a neophyte listener pick up that &quot;Gum&quot; again finds the artist referencing &quot;Confessions of a Futon-Revolutionist&quot;? Unless they&#39;re steeped in a very narrow stripe of the Canadian indie universe, probably not, but it&#39;s also not necessary. Jim may be an underground hero, but his subtle references and overt tributes never feel like a shibboleth. He sings with infectious sincerity and an everyman charm. There&#39;s no code to crack. Whatever universal language sits at the core of good rock&#39;n&#39;roll, Jim speaks it fluently.</p><p>The Brandon, Manitoba artist sheds his old stage name on the twelve-song <em>Jimmie</em>, but it&#39;s less a reinvention than an affirmation. Jim remains affably plainspoken while weaving in new textures. While the artist sources experimental sounds from elaborate auditory sculptures, he deploys them with considerable restraint. Kilpatrick may have bolstered his avant-garde bona fides (while pursuing a Master of Fine Arts under none other than Sonic Youth&#39;s Lee Ranaldo), but his enthusiasm for new noises never gets ahead of his instincts.</p><p>These techniques are most overt on the album-opening &quot;Tape Loop,&quot; recorded using a fifteen-foot, six-device art installation. <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a>&#39; press release elaborates:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;With one player recording the sound of the other five players, as they amplify various points along the loop&#39;s timeline, the installation worked like an accelerated Alvin Lucier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room" class="" target=_blank><em>I Am Sitting in a Room</em></a> machine. With each rotation of the loop the recording degraded and shifted, reinforcing and amplifying dominant room-tones. Tape loop is an aural documentation of time and place but also holds analog technology as a metaphor for the human body - constantly decaying, from time to time in need of repair, and eventually dying.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Any pretension implied by that description isn&#39;t evident in the finished song. While the source sounds of <em>Jimmie</em> seem weighty on paper, they&#39;re in conversation, if not outright contrast, with the artist&#39;s warm accessibility and earnest delivery. The lead single, &quot;Satellite,&quot; exemplifies that discipline. While the track opens with the novel drones of a mechanically-bowed electric guitar sculpture, it quickly shifts into a triumphant, propulsive anthem. For years Jim&#39;s collaborated with Ryan Peters of cult Vancouver rockers <a href="https://ladyhawk.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ladyhawk</a>, and the squelching lineage of that band shines through here. You can see the track visualized in a new video by <a href="https://colinmedley.com/" class="" target=_blank>Colin Medley</a>.</p><p>Peters co-produced and performs on the record, which also features contributions from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/josecontrerasmusik/" class="" target=_blank>José Contreras</a> of <a href="https://bydivineright.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>By Divine Right</a>, cellist <a href="https://www.leannezacharias.com" class="" target=_blank>Leanne Zacharias</a> (Christine Fellows), <a href="https://espanola.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Espanola</a>&#39;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/agoldrules/" class="" target=_blank>Aaron Goldstein</a> (pedal steel go-to for Bry Webb and Danny Romano), and Newfoundland vocalist <a href="https://jeninamacgillivray.com" class="" target=_blank>Jenina MacGillivray</a>.</p><p>You&#39;ve Changed has the record out now on vinyl.

It&#39;s that time again, and with the band&#39;s low-end in flux, they&#39;re again tweaking their formula.</p><p>The relentless &quot;Gallop of the Hounds&quot; sets the stage for <em>The Lash</em>, the Dundas band&#39;s ten-song studio album and their fifth. It promises a stripped-down, back-to-basics approach, contrasting with 2023&#39;s intently indulgent <em>Free Rein To Passions</em>. Look for it on July 25 through <a href="https://dinealonerecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dine Alone Records</a>.</p><p>In a statement, Bentham shared a story from a recent trip to the Vatican, revealing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I was in a very dusty part of the basement, and they had these crazy bronze reliefs that were some of the most brutal things I&#39;ve ever seen. There was a particular one called The Horrors of War. It was two guys fighting over a knife. That image ended up guiding a lot of this record.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>That sensibility is reflected in the medieval brutality on display in the album&#39;s cover art, laid out in a cassette-first format by UK designer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jacksabbat/" class="" target=_blank>Jack Sabbat</a>. The Nil completed <em>The Lash</em> in just a few weeks, recording at Hamilton&#39;s Boxcar Sound with Vince Soliveri (The Drew Thomson Foundation, Pillea).</p><p>In a press release, drummer Kyle Fisher joked about the cathartic bent of their latest material, stating, &quot;I&#39;ve been telling people that this is Luke&#39;s therapy record.&quot;</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1645480148/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://thedirtynil.bandcamp.com/album/gallop-of-the-hounds">Gallop of the Hounds by The Dirty Nil</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=casper_skulls><span class=artist-title><a href="https://casperskulls.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Casper Skulls</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Kit-Cat</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch &quot;Numbing Mind&quot; on <a href="https://youtu.be/YiFqkatMUr0?si=1znRZFm4ES60KMu3" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://casperskulls.bandcamp.com/album/kit-cat" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>In April, the indie rock trio <a href="https://casperskulls.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Casper Skulls</a> returned with a new full-length. The 11-song <em>Kit-Cat</em> arrived through <a href="https://www.nextdoorrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>Next Door Records</a> and found the band embracing new chapters in their lives. The record finds the husband-and-wife core of Melanie St. Pierre-Bednis and Neil Bednis relocating to Sudbury and welcoming their first child. Meanwhile, multi-instrumentalist/drummer Fraser McClean spent time on the road, serving as a guitar tech for Toronto heavyweights PUP and Tokyo Police Club while performing in the acerbic noise-punk act <a href="https://burnerband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Burner</a>.</p><p>St. Pierre-Bednis shared some insight on the band&#39;s collective headspace, noting that they endeavoured to make the record &quot;super fun with no expectations.&quot; The resulting set, tracked over six days at Sudbury&#39;s Deadpan Studios, is just that. Well-mannered and inviting, <em>Kit-Cat</em> is a remarkably breezy listen and a refreshingly unburdened counterpoint to troubling times. The record shines brightest when Melanie and Neil sync up on vocals, as on the shoegaze-tinged &quot;Roddy Piper&quot; and the hooky chorus of the album-opening &quot;Spindletop.&quot;</p><p>The record features guest contributions from Augusta Veno (<a href="https://thelonelyparade.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Lonely Parade</a>) and producer Matt Weiwel. You can see the single &quot;Numbing Mind&quot; highlighted in a playful video from director <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bosmobosmobosmo/" class="" target=_blank>Bosmo</a> that reflects &quot;technology&#39;s role in fostering a self-obsessed and vain culture&quot; by casting the group in a series of retro television roles. Neil commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We felt the video was a fun summation of the song&#39;s meaning. It shows that Mel and I are just as guilty, distracted, and addicted to technology and content as everyone else.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Kit-Cat</em> follows the band&#39;s acclaimed 2021 album <em>Knows No Kindness</em>.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3956000558/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://casperskulls.bandcamp.com/album/kit-cat">Kit-Cat by Casper Skulls</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=the_riptides><span class=artist-title><a href="https://theriptides.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Riptides</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Burn after Listening</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://theriptides.bandcamp.com/album/burn-after-listening" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>In March, Ottawa punk veterans <a href="https://theriptides.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>The Riptides</a> unleashed <em>Burn After Listening</em>, a pandemic-born collection that distills years of pent-up tension into a finely-tuned three-chord assault with both feet firmly planted in the 90s sound. Did you once own at least four Ikea <em>Gnedby</em> CD towers brimming with EpiFat classics in cracked jewel cases? No judgement, fellow traveller! This one&#39;s for you.</p><p>Following up on 2017&#39;s <em>Canadian Graffiti</em>, the album serves as the long-running band&#39;s first outlet to react to years of turbulence. They shared:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This record was born in the weirdest time. There was so much uncertainty, and it gave us room to really go deep. Lyrically, it&#39;s satire, reflection, and frustration—wrapped up in fast hooks and shout-along choruses...</p><p>Every song has its own identity, but together they make up a record that keeps you on your toes. We still sound like us, but this one pushed us creatively—sometimes into uncomfortable places. But that&#39;s what punk is all about, right?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The Riptides brought their new material to one of the genre&#39;s modern meccas, recording in the storied Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with prolific engineers Andrew Berlin and Jason Livermore (Descendents, NOFX, et al.). <a href="https://teenagebottlerocket.com/" class="" target=_blank>Teenage Bottlerocket</a> drummer Darren Chewka and guitarist Kody Templeman perform on the punchy pop-punk single &quot;Bad Habit.&quot; The record also features guest vocals from Austrian mainstay Heavy Kevy (The Apers, Insanity Alert) and Merel Schaap from Rotterdam punk act Lone Wolf.</p><p>This is the sound I grew up on. Pick your pantheon of melodic pop-punk favourites, and there&#39;s a high chance you&#39;ll hear the reflected, lovingly, in The Riptides.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1102286574/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://theriptides.bandcamp.com/album/burn-after-listening">Burn After Listening by The Riptides</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=matthew_doc_dunn><span class=artist-title><a href="https://cosmicrangerecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Matthew "Doc" Dunn</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Tally Ho!&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://cosmicrangerecords.bandcamp.com/album/love-raiders" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Ruminative psych-rock troubadour <a href="https://cosmicrangerecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Matthew &quot;Doc&quot; Dunn</a> has a sprawling double LP ready for the summer.

The former&#39;s a slow-burning, country-fried acid-folk ballad, while the latter kicks over the amps with a fuzzed-out assist from Dinosaur Jr. legend J Mascis. Dunn co-produced the album with longtime collaborator Asher Gould-Murtagh (<a href="https://mrjoy.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Mr. Joy</a>, <a href="https://dr-joy.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Dr. Joy</a>).

The ten-song collection curates and finalizes material that first surfaced as a long-running series of digital singles, issued monthly since the lockdown days of 2020. Some Party covered that run religiously, so it&#39;s nice to see many of those songs - some of the artist&#39;s best - finally get a proper place in his discography. There&#39;s a warm gravity to Page&#39;s solo work, an earned quality that comes from years in the trenches.</p><p>Page recorded the new album throughout 2024 between his home studio in Ottawa&#39;s Vanier neighbourhood (lovingly dubbed &quot;Las Vanier Haus Of Fuzz&quot;). Dave Draves, Chris&#39; bandmate from the early-2000s group power-pop group <a href="https://campradio.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Camp Radio</a>, mixed and mastered at Little Bullhorn. Toronto singer/songwriter <a href="https://lilyfrost.com" class="" target=_blank>Lily Frost</a> appears on the track &quot;Plagiarism Fun.&quot;</p><p>The 10-song record is the latest milestone in a lengthy underground career stretching back to the 90s-era Glengarry, Ontario garage-punk outfit <a href="https://thestandgt.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>The Stand GT</a>. In recent years, Page has performed as half of the droney noise-rock duo <a href="https://expandafuzz.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Expanda Fuzz</a> with Leila Younis.</p><p>In 2022, Chris Page issued <em>Those Aren&#39;t Stars Above Your Head</em>, an acoustic reworking of the self-titled 2016 Camp Radio album.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2937647507/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://chrispage.bandcamp.com/album/split-seconds-on-earth-4">Split Seconds On Earth by Chris Page</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=barnacle><span class=artist-title><a href="https://barnaclemtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Barnacle</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;The Edge&quot; / &quot;Pharmacy&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://barnaclemtl.bandcamp.com/album/the-edge-pharmacy" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Montreal sea-punks <a href="https://barnaclemtl.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Barnacle</a> continue their resurgence with a new two-song single, previewing their upcoming album <em>Live From Rock Bottom</em>. &quot;The Edge&quot; and &quot;Pharmacy&quot; arrived in April, showcasing the evolution since their 2024 LP, <em>Such a Waste</em>.</p><p>Both tracks carry the band&#39;s signature lo-fi sound, anchored by reverb-drenched vocals. This time, they&#39;re employed on songs that feel decidedly darker - with the claustrophobic noise-wall &quot;Pharmacy,&quot; in particular, feeling particularly bleak. It&#39;s a dark shift from a band that made their name with a SpongeBob-shitposting beach-goon aesthetic. If you&#39;ve dug the aggressive weirdness of Sudbury&#39;s Teleporters and Psychbike, you&#39;ll find a similar vibe here.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2902802448/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://barnaclemtl.bandcamp.com/album/the-edge-pharmacy">The Edge / Pharmacy by Barnacle</a></iframe> </body></html> </div> </article> <div class=post-article> <ul class=pagination> <li> <a href="/2025-03-26-luna-fm/" rel=prev title="Previous article: Luna FM"> <div class=pagination-text> <div class=pagination-title>Luna FM</div> <div class=pagination-date>March 26, 2025</div> </div> <span aria-hidden=true>></span> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=bottom-cta-wrapper> <div class=bottom-cta> <h2>React to it at your leisure</h2> <p> Some Party is Adam White's misguided quest to share the latest in Canadian garage rock, punk, psych, and more.

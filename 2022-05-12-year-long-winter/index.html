While I only showed up in the twilight years of the fest&#39;s existence, its impact on this project can&#39;t be understated. I poured over the event&#39;s previous lineups almost as a proof of concept for Some Party - making the case (to myself) that there was enough content for a weekly beat with this particular geographic focus. As I sit here today, buried under submissions, a week late, and scrambling to pull the edition together - that all seems so quaint.</p><p>The bands I saw in 2017 - at the early height of my enthusiasm - remain dear to me. They (and their descendants) are regular mentions here (see: Tough Age, Century Palm, Deathsticks, The Famines, Booji Boys, Partner, Tommy &amp; the Commies, etc.). The fourth edition of Some Party even included a little pre-Explosion guest column from <a href="https://futuregirls.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Future Girls</a>&#39; Heather Grant, who shared a festival recommendation for the (then) St. John&#39;s-based power-pop act <a href="https://bbqtband.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>BBQT</a>. Future Girls and their sibling band <a href="https://crossedwireshfx.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Crossed Wires</a> were top of mind when I got this thing rolling. They seemed to exemplify the elusive quality I was trying to hone in on better than anyone. These were primarily regional Canadian punk acts, operating on a DIY shoestring but somehow forging incredible bonds in disparate scenes across the country. I started Some Party to write about bands like that.</p><p>Of course, smaller-scale acts don&#39;t have much financial incentive to stay together, even in good times, so it&#39;s not surprising that with the pandemic also making the social aspect a drag, we&#39;ll emerge with fewer bands like Future Girls still intact. The five-song <em>Year Long Winter</em> EP may be their swan song, but we&#39;re lucky to have it. The group managed to convene in those fraught early days of COVID, somehow not lost among <a href="http://mattygrace.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Matty Grace</a>&#39;s then-forthcoming barrage of isolation side-projects. The remaining members brought in <a href="https://designosaur.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Designosaur</a>&#39;s Becca Dalley on bass (who&#39;d later join Grace in <a href="https://cluttered.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Cluttered</a>). Guitarist/vocalist Heather Grant and <a href="https://botfly.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Botfly</a> drummer Dewayne Shanks remained on board from the group&#39;s earlier iterations.</p><p>The band feely admits that <em>Year Long Winter</em>&#39;s downtrodden &quot;bummer punk&quot; isn&#39;t the happiest of listens, and it&#39;s objectively not. Regardless it&#39;s putting a smile on my face. I can&#39;t shake what these players represent to me, and they even seem to allude to it in their brief write-up:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It is not cheery, it is not fun but it is an honest continuation of a band that allowed us to make pals with some of the most kind and generous folks around.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Year Long Winter</em> arrives digitally through <a href="https://dirtcultrecords.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Dirt Cult Records</a> and on cassette through Barrie&#39;s <a href="https://tarantulacassettes.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Tarantula Tapes</a>. The latter issued it simultaneously with a tape run of Grace&#39;s recent solo EP, <em>I Was a Fat Stupid</em> (I wrote more on that back in <a href="https://www.someparty.ca/2022-02-09-cling-like-a-fly-to-honey/#matty_grace" class="" target=_blank>February</a>).

The group&#39;s self-titled EP arrives May 26, reworking five favourites from Wilson&#39;s back catalogue into organic rock songs indebted to Neil Young and The Band (with perhaps some of the anthemic clarity of the Joel Plaskett Emergency mixed in). The group features Wilson joined by guitarist R.P. McMurphy and percussionist Joshua Osmond. They shared some history at Bandcamp:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In 2019, the beginnings of Freightliner came together in support of Wilson for a show with The Sadies at Dog Day Afternoon Music Festival. From there, they continued to test their sound on a handful of shows until the pandemic hit in March 2020. While the world sorted itself out, Innes Wilson&#39;s Freightliner spent time in backyard band practices and on a hay-strewn barn floor to coax out their defining sound.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can preview that sound with &quot;To The Letter,&quot; reenvisioning a hooky song from 2019&#39;s <em>The Heart That Holds This Up</em> as a classic country rocker. The band recorded these tunes at a home studio last fall.</p><p>In the summer of 2020, Wilson shared a seven-song set of isolation recordings titled <em>Deference</em>. Over the past year, he also issued four EPs with his pandemic pop-punk project, <a href="https://parttimecool.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Part-Time Cool</a>).</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3860611959/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://inneswilson.bandcamp.com/album/innes-wilsons-freightliner">Innes Wilson's Freightliner by Innes Wilson's Freightliner</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=ian_daniel_kehoe><span class=artist-title><a href="https://iandanielkehoe.bandcamp.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ian Daniel Kehoe</a></span><span class=media-title>&quot;Sweet &amp; Sour&quot;</span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/quQqdprqluQ" class="" target=_blank>YouTube</a> - Preview and purchase at <a href="https://tinangelrecords.bandcamp.com/album/yes-very-so" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>Toronto&#39;s <a href="https://www.iandanielkehoe.com/" class="" target=_blank>Ian Daniel Kehoe</a> impressively hopped genres during the early months of the pandemic, issuing three diverse collections of songs in the summer of 2020.

The quirky track arrived alongside a video painted and animated by the band&#39;s <a href="https://www.arielsharratt.com" class="" target=_blank>Arial Sharratt</a> (her first foray into animation). The group commented:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;You may have heard this song in our live shows over the last couple of years, but it&#39;s finally taking off! We recorded Nigel originally in 2019, and a version came out on [the limited edition lathe-cut EP] <em>Birdwatching on Garbage Island</em>. It&#39;s here now, re-mixed, re-jigged, and with some new treats and finally out for everyone to hear.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The song tells the true story of a failed attempt by New Zealand conservationists to establish a gannet breeding colony on Mana Island. They lured in a single bird (the titular Nigel) with concrete replicas, only to find the creature seemingly content to play out its lonely life among the statues. It&#39;s pretty <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/02/nigel-lonely-new-zealand-gannet-dies-concrete-replica-birds" class="" target=_blank>absurd</a>, but the band makes the low-hanging XTC joke, so at least something good came of it.</p><p>The track finds Mathias Kom on guitar, Jake Nicoll on bass, synth and Wurlitzer, with Sharratt programming drums, with all three credited on vocals. <em>Garbage Island</em> arrives June 24 through <a href="https://bbislandmusic.com/" class="" target=_blank>BB*Island</a> in Europe and <a href="https://youvechangedrecords.com/" class="" target=_blank>You&#39;ve Changed Records</a> in North America.

That socially distanced process took over six months to complete, with vocals eventually tracked in a weekend with Rain City Recorders&#39; Mariessa McLeod.

The demo was originally called Creepy Motel, for that reason, even though the song ended up being about sheep. We spent a long time playing with major and minor transitions, taking inspiration from the Marty Robbin&#39;s Gunfighter Ballads and old westerns. Then Brydon wrote the verses and chord progression, and we battled it all out until basically the night before we went into the studio. For being such a hard-won song, it ended up being one of our collective favourites, for sure.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><em>Winded</em> arrives June 24 via the <a href="https://www.forwardmusicgroup.com/" class="" target=_blank>Forward Music Group</a>.

I feel I&#39;ve always hinted at new wave and sophistapop with the Guv project, and it&#39;s definitely something I will be exploring much more on my next albums. Lyrics were taken from a little notebook I kept on me while in Taos - I actually had written this originally as this Tom Petty folk joint and they then were tried on a side project song for a jokey psych rock band we were calling Taosman 5 - but eventually found their home on this track.

Vocalist Nicholas Smyth commented on the new tune, stating:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This song is about our love-hate-mostly-love-but-sometimes-really-hate relationship with Poland, a country we&#39;ve toured many times. In particular, it&#39;s about a winter tour we did where everything just kept breaking and going wrong, and we kept fighting it and raging against it until we realized that this was normal in Poland, and that you needed to just do what everyone else did: sit back, have a beer and a smoke, and say &#39;to hell with it.&#39; The Poles are amazing at this, it&#39;s actually a really healthy attitude to have in a lot of situations. The song&#39;s title comes from a word that means the same in English and Polish, and we quickly realized that we were going to hear it from our tour manager (who spoke no English) about 18 times a day. &#39;Ah...&#39; he would say, his face scrunching up and worry-creasing his forehead... &#39;Problem&#39;.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new set features 13 songs, following up on 2019&#39;s <em>Into The North</em>.

The band&#39;s Art Ross commented on the album in a press release:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This was always that one little song that I&#39;ve kept in my back pocket. It was almost like a small page ripped from my diary when I was a teen. Because I had written the lyrics so long ago, I truly never thought it would ever escape its coffeehouse vibe. But when I showed Aaron (Green) the song, he revamped it, re-contextualized it, and now it&#39;s a song that invites the listener to reminisce about those reckless times.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The new song follows February&#39;s &quot;Half Moon&quot; single and with it previews the band&#39;s debut LP, due later this year from <a href="https://www.lhmrec.com/" class="" target=_blank>LMH Records</a>.

Inspired by the novel of the same name by Quebecois author Anne Hébert, the album cumulates in the striking murder ballad &quot;Kamouraska.&quot; In the artist&#39;s words:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;&#39;Kamouraska&#39; is the murder ballad of a fictional abused woman who ends her suffering by murdering her spouse, only to be oppressed in a different way - this time by the law. That said, at least the protagonist makes her suffering her own and feels a sort of catharsis from her actions.</p><p>Whereas my first album, <em>Miasma</em>, is rooted in themes of earth and dirt, I picture <em>We&#39;ll All Go</em> with emerging through sounds of water. I wanted to write this album from a point of compassion; trying to understand other perspectives. I hope listeners can find a narrative that they can relate to in these songs.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The record features Keegan Trumpour on lead vocal and electric guitar, backed by Raha Javanfar on violin and Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano, Bry Webb) on drums, bass, and his signature pedal steel.</p><div class=media-wrapper><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" seamless data-src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2520370573/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=3607414115/transparent=true/" class=lazyload><a href="https://opeongomusic.bandcamp.com/album/well-all-go-with-the-will-o-the-wisp">we'll all go with (the will-o'-the-wisp) by Opeongo</a></iframe> </body></html> </div><h3 id=rick_white><span class=artist-title><a href="https://rickwhitearchive.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Rick White</a></span><span class=media-title><em>Rick White plays The Sadies</em></span></h3><p class=media-links data-controller=share><small>Preview and purchase at <a href="https://rickwhitearchive.bandcamp.com/album/rick-white-plays-the-sadies-2022" class="" target=_blank>Bandcamp</a> <span data-share-target=container></span></small></p><p>In the wake of Dallas Good&#39;s death, longtime friend and collaborator <a href="https://rickwhitearchive.bandcamp.com" class="" target=_blank>Rick White</a>&#39;s kicked off a covers series celebrating the work Toronto alt-country legends <a href="https://www.thesadies.net/" class="" target=_blank>The Sadies</a>.
